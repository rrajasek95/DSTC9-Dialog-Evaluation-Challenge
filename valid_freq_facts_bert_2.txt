no_fact; It doesn't take a ton to work the Boston sports media into a lather, so the notion that David Price's case of carpal tunnel syndrome might be related to his enthusiasm for playing video games had a predictable effect. After taking heavy criticism - not least because his injury caused him to miss a start against the archrival Yankees - Price denied Thursday that his pitching-hand woes were the result of too much Fortnite, but nonetheless said he would stop playing the game in the Red Sox clubhouse. "If that was the cause of the problem, then it started back in 1997 when I got my first PlayStation when I was 12 years old," Price said (via masslive.com). "I've always played video games. "I've always played it with my teammates in the offseason, at the field, at the hotel," he continued. "It's kind of my generation. That's what we do. If I need to shut down video games and pick up a new hobby, then so be it.; no_fact;

He is going to start Saturday vs Blue Jays #RedSox #NBC10Boston  - Craig Kolodny (@NBCBostonCraig) May 10, 2018 Much of that "noise" emerged in the wake of a story this week by Jen McCaffrey  of The Athletic, in which she wrote, "The Fortnite phenomenon has invaded the Red Sox clubhouse." McCaffrey quoted Price as saying that he and some teammates regularly play the popular game for hours at a time, and adding, "You can lose track of time whenever you're playing it." That revelation had some Boston columnists disapprovingly connecting the dots to Price's diagnosis. It didn't help that the left-hander hasn't lived up to the seven-year, $217 million contract he signed with the Red Sox in December 2015, with a 2017 season marred by elbow and forearm injuries as well as contentious incidents with the media. "Now, I suppose there could be no correlation between Price's new injury and a new video game that is eating up to one-eighth of Price's daily routine," the Boston Herald's Michael Silverman wrote. "But until I hear or read about some other explanation for the sudden onset of carpal tunnel syndrome in a pitcher, I'll go with what's in front of our face for now." "We have our goofy story from this epic May series in the Bronx," the Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy wrote. ";

Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.;

The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best-selling book of all time.Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.; no_fact; no_fact;
no_fact; no_fact; And while they trust the coach, known for his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense, they adore Brady. "Brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of Patriots fans," Beneke said. "It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.; no_fact;

And promoting good nutrition and fitness is fine, as is having spiritual beliefs. But spare him the idea of Brady as a spiritual figure. "He's trying to sell us a bill of goods," Ryan said. "It's cultlike. The book, to me, is creepy. And it looks like that's going to be his life after football." As for Brady, he appears focused on the big game. And he shows no signs of quitting. "So if you're going to compete against me, you better be willing to give up your life," Brady says in the first episode of "Tom vs. Time." "Because I'm giving up mine.";

The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week.

no_fact; Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week, even though he shows no signs of injury;
no_fact; He should be that good. But with Gordon, it always has been about projecting and wondering. He has been suspended repeatedly under the NFL's substance abuse policy and has played in only 11 regular season NFL games since his breakout season in 2013. His return to the Browns this season lasted all of one game until team officials were left with their patience exhausted and feeling that Gordon had run out of chances with the organization. Belichick may bring out Gordon's best. He is a coach for the ages, but his history with taking chances on players with sullied reputations is mixed. Gordon could be another Moss for Belichick and Brady. Moss had three 1,000-yard receiving seasons with the Patriots, including the wondrous 2007 season in which Brady-to-Moss was as unstoppable as it gets and New England was unbeaten until its stunning Super Bowl defeat to the New York Giants. Or Gordon could be another Albert Haynesworth, whose Patriots tenure lasted six games in 2011 and included three tackles and no sacks. Belichick's coaching magic is not absolute in these cases. All the Patriots have put at risk is the conditional fifth-round draft pick they sent to the Browns in the deal. The trade signals just how badly the Patriots need help at wide receiver. They have made one move after another at the position since March, and the situation remains unsettled. Wide receivers Chris Hogan, Phillip Dorsett and Cordarrelle Patterson totaled 11 catches for 104 yards in Sunday's loss at Jacksonville.; no_fact; no_fact;

To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).;

In an email on Wednesday, an Ailey spokesman wrote that talks are going forward "with a positive, respectful approach." AGMA, the dancers' union, said in a statement, also on Wednesday, that the artists boycotted the gala "based on management's failure to adequately address the group's substandard wages and benefits." Jamar Roberts in Twyla Tharp's The Golden Section. (Paul Kolnik ) Spurning the gala is quite a statement, but the evening's performance didn't give any indication of the unrest to come. Only in looking back on it can you ponder the ironies. "The Golden Section," with its irresistible dance score by David Byrne, is the finale of a longer work by Tharp titled "The Catherine Wheel," after the medieval torture device of the same name. The full piece focuses on a dysfunctional family and its torments. But the finale - the part that Ailey performed - is pure catharsis. The earthly traumas are past; this is the hard-won entry into the divine.;

And while they trust the coach, known for his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense, they adore Brady. "Brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of Patriots fans," Beneke said. "It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.;

Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.  Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.There are costs and benefits to car use.The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986.; the car brand Cadillac was named after French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac who founded Detroit.;

Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her unconventionality and provocative work, as well as visual experimentation. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a music career. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, Gaga worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution in 2007. She rose to prominence the following year with her debut album, the electropop record The Fame, and its chart-topping singles "Just Dance" and "Poker Face". A follow-up EP, The Fame Monster (2009), featuring the singles "Bad Romance", "Telephone", and "Alejandro", also proved successful.; no_fact; no_fact;

Of course, nothing gold can stay. As Jackson's and Ally's fates intersect, collide and, finally, fatally diverge, "A Star is Born" lives up to the operatic tragedy hinted at by the arias that often play in the background. Cooper handles those tonal shifts with confidence as well, as sweaty immediacy becomes something more intimate and soul-baring. As an actress, Gaga may not yet possess the range she has as a singer, but with the help of editor Jay Cassidy, the film is shaped to make the most of her gifts. There are sequences in "A Star is Born" when it feels like a showdown between the best eyes in the business. It's when she sings that she comes radiantly into her own, claiming the screen as totally as Ally claims the spotlight when her turn comes.; in Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

"Sometimes you have to support and sometimes you have to tell him the truth, that, 'Hey, you have to wake up,'" said Robert, who played over 20 years of professional hockey, including a brief stint in the NHL with the Ottawa Senators. "Andre has always, always, always put up some goals, and he always want to play good and have his goal and he always made goals, but Andre never had a tough time in hockey. Always everything was going well, and suddenly, you have a tough time in your career. That's normal; everybody has that. And it's really tough to come out of it." Burakovsky scored 17 goals two seasons ago, and he played brilliantly in the second round of the playoffs last year.;

Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.; Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player Rene "The Crocodile" Lacoste and only later adopted by polo players;

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.;

there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have, and that dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives; The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".;

no_fact; To be a prelapsarian conservative in America today - as that creed was understood before 2016 - means getting used to heartbreak. One after another, conservatives that I have admired and respected - Paul D. Ryan, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Bill Bennett, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Scott Walker and many others - have failed the Trump test. They have sacrificed their purported principles to curry favor with a populist demagogue who is turning the Republican Party into the American version of France's National Front. The most conspicuous Republican to fall from grace - and he had a long way to fall because he once reached such a lofty pinnacle - is Rudolph W. Giuliani. He has gone, in Joe Scarborough's biting but accurate phrase, from "America's mayor" to Trump's chump. But not even the gaudy, post-9/11 phrase "America's mayor" can convey the true depth of Giuliani's achievement, especially to a non-New Yorker. Giuliani, more than any other individual, made New York what it is today: one of the safest, richest and most dynamic cities in the world. There is not in Manhattan today a single "bad" neighborhood - every part of the borough is thriving, and Brooklyn is catching up fast. This was not the case when Giuliani became mayor in 1994, the very year I moved to New York. Back then the city was being asphyxiated by crime, economic malaise, racial tensions, graffiti, garbage, dysfunctional but expensive government and myriad other ills.;

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).;

Since our furniture was going to be pushed to the center of each room, why not lighten the load? I'm in the "out of sight, out of mind" school. God invented things with doors - cabinets, dressers - so you could keep stuffing your possessions inside and forget about them. Ruth was having none of it. The books, especially, were a problem. Did we want to move them all twice: off the bookshelves and into the basement, and then out of the basement and back to the bookshelves? Some, sure: the first-edition of Orwell's "1984." But if I hadn't yet read that hardback on the history of peanut butter, was I ever going to read it? So, some books were set aside to donate. Other household items were thrown away during a trip to the transfer station. That's always satisfying. You get to open the back of your car and just toss stuff out. I tell you, no Artemis loosed an arrow with as much grace as Ruth did when she flung an old metal hamper frame into a pile of broken refrigerators and rusting window AC units, where it landed with a satisfying "clang." But getting rid of an old metal hamper frame is one thing. My records, CDs and cassette tapes are another. They're personal. Not that I was totally averse to pruning. I could accept that there was some duplication.;

no_fact; I started with LPs that Ruth and I both owned that had somehow nestled together for 30 years. I saved the better copy, unless Ruth had written on the inner sleeve of the other one, fixing typos or correcting erroneous lyrics, in which case I saved that one as a reminder that My Lovely Wife has always been the sort of person who proofreads liner notes. CDs I was never going to listen to went in the giveaway pile, too. That included three year's worth of the CD samplers that came every month with College Music Journal. This saddened me. But even if I binge-listened to all of it, it would only provide me with a grounding of alternative music of the mid-1990s. I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna ask me now what I think of Chumbawamba or Superchunk. Then there were the cassette tapes. People make fun of that obsolete technology today, but there was a time when it was cutting edge. Or cutting middle, anyway. The cassette tape was the birth control pill of personal audio, symbolizing freedom and choice: Listen to it in your home, on your person, in your car! And when it got tangled and mangled in the tape deck of your Toyota Tercel, roll down the window and chuck it out, holding a bit of the brown ribbon between your fingers as you let it unspool in the slipstream. So, I have a fondness for cassettes. But even I had to admit that a TDK dub of Marshall Crenshaw's debut album was surplus when I also had it on vinyl and CD (and iTunes). Out it went. But what do you do with a mix tape? Those musical scrapbooks expressed real personality. They also represented real toil.;

There was no sending the track list to the inkjet, either. You had to handwrite each song title and artist. Or artist, then title. And commas to separate? Or semicolons? Whatever mix tapes I made for old girlfriends are, like the girlfriends themselves, long gone: in their closets or basements or nearest landfills. (The tapes, not the girlfriends.) What I had were stacks of party tapes. These had been crafted with care - and no small amount of wishful thinking. Side One of Tape One would start slow and mellow - guest-arrival music - then build in tempo and intensity until somewhere around Tape Three the bacchanalia soundtrack kicked in. That was the idea, anyway. These days, I guess it's easier just to say, "Alexa: Play orgy music." Of course, I never would. Wouldn't want to mess up the new paint.

In a September 2015 radio interview, Cohen suggested that Trump meet with the Russian president while he was in New York to attend the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Prosecutors said that Cohen later claimed the comments were spur of the moment, but he has admitted in recent weeks that he conferred with Trump about reaching out to the Russian government. The fall 2015 contact came at an important time in the campaign. As Trump's candidacy was starting to heat up, Putin appeared to grow more interested in his effort. On Dec. 17, 2015, Putin attracted notice by offering praise for the celebrity businessman, calling him "colorful and talented" and the "absolute leader of the presidential race." Trump returned the compliment the next day, calling Putin "a leader, unlike what we have in this country.";

[After Gary Oldman's Oscar win, people are bringing up his assault allegation] He pointed specifically to a recent piece in the Daily Mail, the British tabloid, in which Fiorentino said Gary Oldman "yelled at me constantly, ruined my life and stole my children." "Our marriage was a giant car crash in which demented things happened. I lost my self-esteem, I was broken," Fiorentino told the British tabloid. "I've been empowered by hearing other women speak up. When a woman gets her voice back, she gets her power back." In the same piece, Gary Oldman said that Fiorentino's alleged addiction to pills and alcohol caused their marriage's demise. Gulliver Oldman wrote that while he stopped speaking to his mother seven years ago, he isn't trying to speak ill of her. But "my brother and I both have played the role of pawn on numerous occasions throughout our lives in a big game our mother has been desperately trying to play against our father.; no_fact;

Many major media outlets - The Washington Post included - recalled an incident between Oldman and his ex-wife Donya Fiorentino from 17 years ago. "As I picked up the phone to call the police, Gary put his hand on my neck and squeezed," she alleged in a 2001 divorce filing. "I backed away, with the phone receiver in my hand. I tried to dial 911. Gary grabbed the phone receiver from my hand, and hit me in the face with the telephone receiver three or four times. Both of the children were crying.";

A quarterback (commonly abbreviated "QB") is a position in American and Canadian football. Quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive line. In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle. The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes.; Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL;

no_fact; Rock has always opined about relationships and what he views as differences between men and women. Now he is letting the audience in on how he is speaking from his own particular lived experience. In "Tamborine" he lays it out all out there: He cheated on his wife, had a porn addiction, got divorced and went through a brutal custody battle. You may not like his conclusions, but those confessions lay the groundwork for the kind of intimate comedy that is thrilling to hear a stand-up as masterful as Rock tackle. "I was not a good husband. I was addicted to porn," he says as he launches into a bit about how much pornography desensitized him. Later, Rock announces his divorce and tells those clapping in the audience to stop "unless you a lawyer. You don't want to get divorced, let me tell you right now. I'm talking from hell." (Expletives in the video below) The first half of the special is familiar Chris Rock territory. He jokes about raising kids, racism and how America treats black men.;

"A big part of this - and it was something that Chris really wanted - was to feel the intimacy of the space and feel how close the audience was to him," Burnham told Splitsider. Although it is his first special in a decade, Rock has not been absent from the spotlight. Aside from his 2017 tour, during which he refined the material for "Tamborine," Rock lent his voice "Madagascar" movies, acted alongside Adam Sandler in the "Grown Ups" franchise and wrote, directed and starred in "Top Five." Rock brought his stand-up to TV in shorter bits during his 2016 Oscars hosting gig (where he got some flak for a joke about Asian Americans) and "Saturday Night Live" in 2014. He has also helped put TV shows on air, getting executive production credits on "Everybody Hates Chris," based on his childhood, and BET's "The Rundown with Robin Thede." Putting together a stand-up special is a different beast. Usually comics spend a year or so touring with the material before filming the final product. Perhaps the lure of a lucrative Netflix deal (reportedly $40 million for a pair of specials) and the money from a tour was too good to pass up. "That's what alimony will do to you," Rock quipped at his first tour stop, in South Carolina. Whatever the reason, now anyone with a Netflix account gets to experience a new kind of Chris Rock.; no_fact;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.; no_fact;

Voting is a method for a group, such as a meeting or an electorate, to make a collective decision or express an opinion, usually following discussions, debates or election campaigns. Democracies elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called "constituents", and those constituents who cast a ballot for their chosen candidate are called "voters".  There are different systems for collecting votes.;

It will need "formal royal assent" by the governor general before it becomes law, but that is expected to be granted.

"I'm guessing on a list of 20, this is about 20th for most families just trying to make ends meet." Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Weir composed "O Canada." He drafted the song's English lyrics. Calixa Lavall?e composed the music. The original French lyrics were written by Adolphe-Basile Routhier.;

The offending line - "in all thy sons command" - was switched to "in all of us command." Mauril's bill to make O Canada gender neutral passed third reading in the Senate tonight - another positive step towards gender equality. #inallofuscommand - Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 1, 2018 The Canadian anthem's English lyrics were written by judge and poet Robert Stanley Weir in 1908. His original words did not include the offending line, which was added by Weir after World War I to reference the men who lost their lives in battle.

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".;

One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.;

no_fact; In Tondo, for example, home to Manila's largest slum, every square mile of land is shared among 200,000 people or more. Many live in small, 50-square-foot shacks made of zinc roofs, wooden blocks and sheets of black tarp. With little space indoors and limited access to public spaces such as malls and parks, these slum-dwellers tend to pass their time on the streets, earning the name "tambays" - an adaptation of the English word "standbys," explained Richard Heydarian, a professor of political science in Manila. Many of these "street kids" arrested in the past few weeks were probably found outside their shanty houses because they were looking for errands that could earn them an extra buck or were finding a spot to cool off from the 80-degree weather, he added. [Understanding Duterte's mind-boggling rise to power] Residents stand on a rooftop of a shanty tenement house while newly built condominium buildings are seen in the background in Tondo district, Manila, on March 11. (Dondi Tawatao/Reuters) Since the order, tambays have been brought in on a variety of charges: some for drinking or smoking in the streets and others for public nudity or for violating local curfew laws, reported the Manila Standard. But in many cases, according to Heydarian, the crime being committed is not immediately clear. [Witnesses to Duterte's drug war] Genesis Argoncillo, a 25-year-old Filipino, was arrested outside his house June 15. Four days later, he died in detention at the Quezon City Police District, sparking outrage across the nation.

no_fact; In one of my worst parenting moments, my younger daughter screamed, "Why are you always criticizing me?" and I screamed back, "Because you never do anything right!" We laugh about it now - I do, anyway. She lives in New York City, studying acting and working as a modern dancer; waitressing pays the bills. I know enough to keep my concerns vague and my support enthusiastic. We fathers eventually become like wildlife photographers, quiet but hyperattentive, grateful for any sighting. "Upstate," by James Wood (Farrar, Straus and Giroux ) "Upstate," a new novel by the literary critic James Wood, brought this into focus for me as never before. It's a slim book with a tiny cast doing little in a remote place, but it captures the anxious plight of a loving father with exquisite delicacy. Indeed, "Upstate" feels like a finely cut rebuttal to the hysterical realism of those sprawling social novels that Wood has famously criticized. But its affections are large, and its wisdom deep - a wonderful exception amid the voluminous literature of bad fathers. The story takes place over a few days in early 2007 when a British real estate developer named Alan Querry is just starting to smell the smoke that will eventually burst into flame and destroy the world's economy. At the moment, though, Alan is more alarmed by a cryptic message about his 40-year-old daughter in upstate New York. Vanessa, a philosophy professor at Skidmore College, seems to have fallen into a dangerous bout of depression. Determined to figure out what's wrong, he and his younger daughter, Helen, go for a visit. [Sarah Jessica Parker thinks she knows what you should read.;
In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.; McDonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues.; no_fact;

So it's no secret that Shelton will actively support a contestant's career, which makes him an appealing choice for auditioners.

Ever since "American Idol," country music fans have enthusiastically voted on reality singing competitions. "The Voice" is often criticized for not being able to produce stars, but the country acts who have won - Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sundance Head - typically fare better than winners from other genres. At a recent country radio conference in Nashville, when asked why country contestants do so well on "The Voice," the Swon Brothers (who landed in third place in Season 4) responded simply "Blake Shelton." "We got his phone number, we have stayed at his house, we have hunted at his house. There's a personal connection, he goes above and beyond," Colton Swon said. "He's been like a big brother." "And he had our back when things got a little tricky," added his brother, Zach. The Swon Brothers got a record deal after "The Voice," though were later dropped, and are now releasing music independently. Shelton's Music City connections have helped other team members; he gave Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7 winner in 2014) a song he had been saving for his own catalogue, called "My Baby's Got a Smile On Her Face." Boyd's recording became the second song in history to debut at No.; no_fact; 1 on the Billboard country chart. Recently, Shelton took Sundance Head (Season 11 winner in 2016) with him on tour.

no_fact; Country music, also known as  country and western (or simply country), and hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk and Western music) and blues.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.According to Lindsey Starnes, the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.;

Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "action" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek: δράω, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. ;

no_fact; no_fact; Daisuke Matsuzaka was a star in Japan before he even finished high school. (Naoya Osato/Kyodo News/Associated Press) The legend of Daisuke Matsuzaka - the Boston Red Sox flameout and architect of the mythic "gyro ball" - began with a 148-pitch shutout in the summer of 1998. That performance came in the round of 16 of Japan's national high school baseball tournament, called the summer Koshien. A day later, he threw 250 pitches in 17 innings in the quarterfinal. The next day, he started in left field but then pitched in relief as his team trailed 6-0; it scored seven runs in the last two innings to win. Then he threw a no-hitter to win the championship game. Matsuzaka's place in Japan's baseball folklore was solidified. The summer Koshien gets the hype of the NCAA men's basketball tournament plus the "aw" factor of the Little League World Series. For the month of August each year, the Hanshin Tigers, a top-tier professional team, give up their home field so 56 high schools can compete every day on national television for one of Japan's most revered athletic prizes. "Everyone who plays baseball has dreamed of playing at that stage," said Yosuke Tsuji, associate professor of global business at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. "And for fans, baseball is a pastime, and everyone watches the games over summer break.";
Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

A boot is a type of footwear and not a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality – protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking), or may have hobnails on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip; and for reasons of style and fashion.; no_fact;

Literature, most generically, is any body of written works.More restrictively, literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera: letter or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts.The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature), and non-written verbal art forms.Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature.Literature is classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction, and whether it is poetry or prose.It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).; no_fact;

Reacting to Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh's decision to forgo teaching at Harvard Law School next year, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Oct. 2 said the confirmation process has been a "search and destroy mission" to "take out" Kavanaugh's reputation. (The Washington Post) We've known for months that Republicans obstructed the Obama administration's attempts to warn states and the public about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Post previously reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in particular threatened to label "any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics." But a new book from The Post's Greg Miller contains a chilling McConnell quote that shows just how paranoid the entire GOP has become. In late summer 2016, Miller writes, then-CIA Director John Brennan hurriedly arranged meetings with senior congressional leaders over intelligence that Putin had authorized "a covert operation aimed at destablizing the American presidential election."

no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.; the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court on the top floor known as "The Highest Court in the Land";

SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-in is set to deploy some high-level gastrodiplomacy as he tries to win over North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Friday's summit. At a dinner scheduled for after their historic talks, the South will put on a banquet that is both lavish - after all, Kim looks like a man who enjoys his food - and infused with meaning. It features ingredients from the home towns of pro-engagement South Korean presidents, cold noodles from a famous North Korean restaurant and, strikingly, potato r?sti - a nod to the fact that Kim spent four years in Switzerland as a teenager. South Korea is preparing quite a feast for the summit between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in on Friday. Every dish is imbued with some special meaning. That includes this Swiss-style rosti potato pancake -- a nod to Kim's teenage years in Bern (photo from South Korea's Blue House)  - Anna Fifield (@annafifield) April 24, 2018 Although South Korea designed the menu, it appears to be a tacit acknowledgement from North Korea that the leader did go to school in Switzerland. It also set off a wave of speculation that Geneva had been chosen as the location for the summit between Kim and President Trump. "The welcome banquet is designed to reflect the efforts of those who worked hard for peace and the reunification of our people," said Kim Eui-kyeom, spokesman for the South's presidential Blue House.; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; Tom Brady, Calvin Johnson, Carson Palmer and Jimmy Graham all have NFL rules named after them.;
Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He is one of only two players in NFL history to have won five Super Bowls (along with defensive player Charles Haley), and he is the only player to have won them all with a single franchise. Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest "steal" in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's sixteen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner.;
Rob Gronkowski said after the Super Bowl that he would ponder his future in football this offseason (Adam Glanzman/Getty Images) It has been two months since Rob Gronkowski followed the New England Patriots' Super Bowl defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles by saying he would contemplate his football future this offseason, seemingly leaving open the possibility of retiring. Now, with free agency basically finished league-wide and the NFL draft nearing, there still has been no official resolution to Gronkowski's playing status for the 2018 season, although most indications are that he's likely to play. The filling-in-the-blanks portion of the story line has included increasing speculation that the Patriots could receive trade offers for Gronkowski and might be willing to entertain them. It is, at first glance, next to unthinkable that the Patriots would consider trading Gronkowski, who remains a cornerstone of their offense and still is one of the league's most productive tight ends at age 28. [Robert Kraft says that he has met with Bill Belichick and Tom Brady since the Super Bowl] But to totally dismiss any notion that the Patriots would consider parting with Gronkowski is to ignore how Coach Bill Belichick has done business throughout his time in New England. The Patriots have been the greatest NFL dynasty in the era of the salary cap and free agency in large part because Belichick has been the least sentimental roster architect in the sport. He makes the tough moves. He looks forward, not backward. He moves on well before it is, in his view, too late. Belichick has, over the years, unflinchingly said abrupt goodbyes to players such as Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, Mike Vrabel, Richard Seymour, Randy Moss, Logan Mankins and Chandler Jones. He undoubtedly would not hesitate to part with Gronkowski if he thought it was the right thing to do and the proper time to do it had arrived. Owner Robert Kraft has said Belichick will coach the Patriots as long as he wants to do so.;
I have faith in Bill as a coach that I don't think there's anyone who has the football knowledge and expertise combined with understanding personnel, no one can merge those two worlds [better]. And he's done pretty well for us over the last 18 years. So, as a fan, I can question some of the moves. As someone who's privileged to be the owner of this team, I encourage him to keep going with his instincts and doing what he thinks is right." It is difficult to imagine the Patriots without Gronkowski. But, then, it once was difficult to imagine the Patriots without Law or Milloy or Vrabel or Moss or some of the other players sent on their way by Belichick. It was difficult to imagine the Patriots playing the entire Super Bowl without Butler on the field for a single defensive snap. It would be surprising if Belichick and the Patriots decide they're better off without Gronkowski than with him. It would be significant, for sure. But stunning? No one should put it in that category, if it happens, after taking Belichick's roster-crafting history into account.;

Kraft said last week at the annual league meeting that he'd met, as promised, with Belichick and Brady since the Super Bowl loss. Kraft continued to dismiss the talk of dysfunction, saying that disagreements are part of being in business and, really, part of life. Kraft also spoke admiringly last week of Gronkowski's approach. "I saw him a few weeks ago come into the building after hours," Kraft said then. "But I should say one thing when it comes to Gronk: I've met a lot of people in my life. I've never met anyone like him. If the Good Lord lets us come back as someone - I've said it before - he's the most carefree, happy, up kind of guy." Yet Kraft also made it clear last week, when asked about Belichick's benching of now-departed cornerback Malcolm Butler in the Super Bowl, that he remains supportive of whatever Belichick decides, given that Belichick's record of coaching success has earned him the benefit of the doubt many times over. [Aaron Donald's scary looking workout was real, but the knives apparently were not] "With my fan hat on, you can come up with all kinds of reasons or things," Kraft said at the league meeting of the Butler benching. "But here's the deal: We in New England are privileged to, I believe, have the greatest coach in the history of coaching. ...;

Belichick does not afford the same job security to players. The difficult thing would be determining Gronkowski's worth. He remains a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses when he's healthy and when he's right. He has been the Patriots' most indispensable player after quarterback Tom Brady. He was very good again last season, with 69 catches for 1,084 yards and eight touchdowns in 14 games. But his health and availability have been issues over the years. He hasn't played 16 games in a season since 2011. He has played fewer than 12 games in a season three times over the past six years. [Jim Mora says Josh Rosen needs to be 'challenged' intellectually] No one questions Gronkowski's competitiveness. Not even remotely. But his carefree off-field demeanor comes in contrast to the usually grim, unwavering, around-the-clock ruthlessness displayed by Belichick and Brady. There has been speculation about frustrations on both sides of the relationship between Belichick and Gronkowski, adding to the melodrama engulfing the organization after last season's reports of internal strife involving Brady, Belichick and Kraft.;

Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo. Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago. Nonetheless, in November 2018, scientists reported that nearly all extant populations of animals, including humans, may be a result of a population expansion that began between one and two hundred thousand years ago, based on genetic mitochondrial DNA studies. As such, humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a profound impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.;

A horror film is a film that seeks to elicit fear. Initially inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has existed as a film genre for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.; That it works as well as it does is thanks to a screenplay that largely drops Cody's signature sarcasm - so often used to mask painful underlying secrets - for a voice that is much more raw and direct. Not that "Tully" is cin?ma v?rit?, by any means. Things are never exactly what they seem here - but there's a deeper, more authentic story Reitman and Cody are interested in telling, even when - maybe especially when - the film veers toward fantasy. If "Tully" is a movie that cheats, even lies to us a little bit, it's to get at a more real and recognizable truth. R. At area theaters. Contains coarse language and some sexuality and nudity. 96 minutes.;
if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art, you will enjoy the art more;
In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.;

NBC hockey play-by-play man Mike "Doc" Emrick, left, talks with analyst Eddie Olczyk. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) Each spring brings a tortured-yet-friendly handoff of hockey's broadcasts from regional networks to national crews. Joe Beninati, Craig Laughlin, Al Koken and the rest of the NBC Sports Washington broadcast team endure the ebbs and flows and doldrums of an 82-game NHL season, stretching from early October into mid-April, when the truly elite hockey clubs emerge. Then they step aside. "The only bit of solace we get," said Koken, who has covered the Capitals since 1984, "is that we get to listen to the great Doc Emrick." That would be the lead voice of NBC's national hockey coverage, a 71-year-old who has been in the business 45 years and who has never learned to skate. Mike "Doc" Emrick is the man of a thousand phrases, with an encyclopedic knowledge of hockey and energy to spare. He won an Emmy for "Outstanding Sports Personality - Play-by-Play" in 2011, the same year he was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, and won the Emmy again in 2014, 2015 and 2016. When the NHL was locked out for the 2012-13 season, Emrick went to Troy, Mich., about 45 miles from his home, to call a 12-year-old girls' youth hockey game. "We're all professionals," Koken said, "but if there was ever a night where they said, 'We ran out of money, but would you still please do this game for us?'; no_fact;

"If you do it like him, you're going to be just fine," Beninati recalled the owner telling him. That meant developing a rhythm that drew fans into the game and describing the action with a vocabulary that magnified the experience. All of those anecdotes Emrick has stored up over the years also make audiences trust his authority, Koken said. [It was never a curse. It was just sports, and Capitals have D.C. on the right side.] His vernacular - Deadspin once counted 140 ways Emrick used to describe passing the puck in a single game, then mashed them all up in a Daft-Punk-like remix - tells viewers he's experiencing the sport's joy in the same way they are, said Kenny Albert, who will have the national radio call of the Stanley Cup finals for Westwood One.

Doc would say, 'Absolutely.' " [Between Capitals' trips to Stanley Cup finals, Washington hockey transformed] Emrick is the voice to whom all others in hockey broadcasting are compared. Born in tiny La Fontaine, Ind., he grew up a baseball fanatic until his parents took him to a minor league hockey game in 1960. He was hooked. In graduate school at Bowling Green, he got his first chance to call a hockey game, drawn to its fast pace and hard hits, he has told countless interviewers. Doing play-by-play was crucial because it allowed him to stop paying for tickets. All the while, he was working his way to a doctorate in communications - hence the nickname "Doc." And as hockey emerged as North America's fourth major professional sport, Emrick emerged with it, touting years worth of knowledge to new fans, with a vocabulary and cadence that transfixed television viewers and radio listeners. He became the godfather of announcing hockey on television, said Beninati, the Capitals' longtime play-by-play man. As a young broadcaster with the minor league Maine Mariners, Beninati used to send Emrick tapes of his broadcasts and ask for feedback.; no_fact;

The nine-time all-star, who has earned back-to-back Finals MVP honors in leading the Warriors to consecutive NBA titles, is expected to again exercise the clause this summer and hit the market, although he may well end up staying with the Warriors.Asked Tuesday if Durant&rsquo;s possible departure in free agency was a &ldquo;festering&rdquo; issue in the locker room, Myers said he did not think it was, instead pointing to how &ldquo;hard&rdquo; it is to win championships and claiming, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all anybody&rsquo;s thinking about, because I think that&rsquo;s all you can think about.&rdquo;&ldquo;Nobody ever talks about Kevin&rsquo;s free agency,&rdquo; Kerr added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re focused on this year.&rdquo;As Anthony Slater of the Athletic pointed out Tuesday, though, that kind of ongoing contract situation caused stress and uncertainty in Cleveland when LeBron James continued to sign such deals rather than commit long-term to the Cavaliers.;

Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

Country music, also known as  country and western (or simply country), and hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk and Western music) and blues.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.According to Lindsey Starnes, the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.;

In Minnesota, like the rest of the country, plenty of people recognize that groping someone's buttocks without their consent is not okay. Even the allegation of groping has brought serious consequences for some high-profile figures in the state. Al Franken, Minnesota's former senator, resigned earlier this year after several women came forward with claims that he grabbed their buttocks while they posed for photos with him. A former state senator also recently stepped down after he was accused of groping a female candidate's behind at a political event. (Both men have said, with varying degrees of equivocation, that they remembered their encounters differently than their accusers did.) But there's no law against in Minnesota against deliberately touching someone's backside without permission, as long as it's clothed. In fact, the state's main sexual conduct statute specifically exempts "intentional touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the buttocks" from criminal sexual conduct. This loophole has been on the books since 1988 - not very long, in the grand scheme of things, but long enough that there's ambiguity over how it got there. Now the legislature is taking steps to make sure that this type of inappropriate grabbing will be treated as a crime in the North Star State.; no_fact;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; no_fact; no_fact;
Host Jimmy Kimmel opens the 90th Academy Awards. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson) Academy Awards host Jimmy Kimmel quickly dispelled questions about whether he would address the #MeToo movement during the show on Sunday night. In the end, the surprise wasn't that Kimmel talked about one of the biggest news stories of the past six months. It was what he said. At the same time as Kimmel emphasized the importance of initiatives like #MeToo and #TimesUp, he outlined the limits of Hollywood's power to stop sexual harassment and other manifestations of gender inequality. Kimmel's monologue underscored the scope of Hollywood's gender problem. The industry, he suggested, misjudged women's tastes: "We made a movie called 'What Women Want,' and it starred Mel Gibson." That issue is magnified by the strikingly small number of movies that are directed by women - 11 percent, a figure Kimmel pronounced "nuts." Kimmel used the different salaries Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg received for reshoots on Ridley Scott's "All The Money in the World" to imply that actresses can't even trust their agents, who would profit if their female clients received more compensation, to fight for pay equity.; And all of those complaints are in addition to horrifying accounts of sexual harassment that have wracked the industry since October, when the New York Times and the New Yorker published accounts of disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual predations. Since that time, huge numbers of women have stepped forward to recount decades of harassment, assault and abuses of power they say they experienced at the hands of influential men in the industry. Those allegations shaped the Oscars this year in ways large and small. Casey Affleck won Best Actor in 2017 for his performance in "Manchester by the Sea," an honor that under normal circumstances would have set him up to present the Best Actress statue at this year's ceremony. But due to a pair of sexual harassment allegations against Affleck that he denied and eventually settled out of court, Affleck was replaced as a presenter. Ryan Seacrest, by contrast, hosted E! 's red carpet coverage of the Oscars despite allegations of sexual misconduct made by his former stylist. Seacrest's presence resulted in at least one wildly awkward moment, when Taraji P. Henson told him that "the universe has a way of taking care of good people" during an interview. Shining bright lights on the dark corners of an industry and seeing what cockroaches scuttle out is an important first step.; no_fact;

But it's not the only necessary one. And Kimmel's monologue suggested that Hollywood may only be able to do so much to clean out those dark corners for good. Yes, Kimmel told the audience, it's a good thing that Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Someone who is accused of using his power in an industry to prey on other members of his professional community shouldn't be part of an elite body within that community, and certainly not one that awards its highest honors. But as significant as Weinstein's excommunication from the entertainment industry's most important body might be, the punishment also demonstrates the limits of the sanctions Hollywood can impose on malefactors. The only other person to have been thrown out of the academy, Kimmel pointed out, is Carmine Caridi, who was punished for sharing the screeners Academy members receive each year. "Caridi," Kimmel said, "got the same punishment as Harvey Weinstein for giving his neighbor a copy of 'Seabiscuit' on VHS." It was a pretty funny line, and it revealed just how few options the entertainment industry has for expressing disapproval: It has to use the same tools to punish people who commit wildly different sins. And even more to the point, throwing someone out of the academy is not the same thing as ensuring the legal system works, or making recompense for all the years in which the countless people who had suspicions about Weinstein's alleged behavior failed to act.; This willful blindness is an epidemic in the entertainment industry. There's so much more work to be done, and so few mechanisms the entertainment industry can use to police itself. And if things are bad in Hollywood, the climb may be even steeper everywhere else. "If we are successful here, if we can work together on sexual harassment in the workplace, women will only have to deal with sexual harassment all the time at every other place they go," Kimmel said, deadpan. That's not entirely true: The TIME'S UP Legal Defense Fund, organized by women in Hollywood, is intended to provide financial support to people who might not otherwise be able to pursue sexual harassment claims in court.

no_fact; This willful blindness is an epidemic in the entertainment industry. There's so much more work to be done, and so few mechanisms the entertainment industry can use to police itself. And if things are bad in Hollywood, the climb may be even steeper everywhere else. "If we are successful here, if we can work together on sexual harassment in the workplace, women will only have to deal with sexual harassment all the time at every other place they go," Kimmel said, deadpan. That's not entirely true: The TIME'S UP Legal Defense Fund, organized by women in Hollywood, is intended to provide financial support to people who might not otherwise be able to pursue sexual harassment claims in court. But changing the culture and practices of one industry is hard enough. Doing it everywhere is a deeply daunting task. For all the Academy Awards celebrate the power of movies, solving sexual harassment is going to require more than merely setting a good example, if Hollywood can even manage to do that.;
Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; no_fact; And all of those complaints are in addition to horrifying accounts of sexual harassment that have wracked the industry since October, when the New York Times and the New Yorker published accounts of disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual predations. Since that time, huge numbers of women have stepped forward to recount decades of harassment, assault and abuses of power they say they experienced at the hands of influential men in the industry. Those allegations shaped the Oscars this year in ways large and small. Casey Affleck won Best Actor in 2017 for his performance in "Manchester by the Sea," an honor that under normal circumstances would have set him up to present the Best Actress statue at this year's ceremony. But due to a pair of sexual harassment allegations against Affleck that he denied and eventually settled out of court, Affleck was replaced as a presenter. Ryan Seacrest, by contrast, hosted E! 's red carpet coverage of the Oscars despite allegations of sexual misconduct made by his former stylist. Seacrest's presence resulted in at least one wildly awkward moment, when Taraji P. Henson told him that "the universe has a way of taking care of good people" during an interview. Shining bright lights on the dark corners of an industry and seeing what cockroaches scuttle out is an important first step.;

no_fact; Steve Smith Sr., shown in 2014, is learning how to deal with depression. (Evan Habeeb/USA Today) Over 16 seasons in the NFL, Steve Smith Sr. developed a reputation for being one of the toughest wide receivers in the game. But he never really appreciated the accolades and stats he piled up, he says now, because he was struggling with depression throughout his playing career. "Despite all of my achievements, I routinely felt trapped, inferior and alone," Smith wrote this week in a first-person column on NFL.com. "This overwhelmed me internally and often left me mentally, physically and emotionally broken." Such struggles among pro athletes have become a regular media topic in recent days; last weekend, for example, former Philadelphia Eagles great Brian Dawkins said in his Hall of Fame induction speech that his deepest days of depression led him to consider methods of suicide that would allow his family to collect on his life insurance. For Smith, the 1,031 career catches for 14,731 yards (eighth all-time) and 81 touchdowns with the Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens didn't really register, he wrote in the column, because of his internal battles. "I never truly enjoyed those moments," he wrote, "never felt genuine delight in my accomplishments." His playing persona seemed invulnerable, impossibly strong and feisty, willing to take on all defenders.;

- and most importantly, how to prohibit that critical voice inside my head from defining who I am on an everyday basis." Smith, 39, urged anyone considering the core question he grappled with - what's wrong with me? - to ask for help. In that, he echoed other athletes who have come forward in recent years with their own stories about depression. Chargers tackle Joe Barksdale explained to the Los Angeles Times, "Some days you can talk yourself out of it. Some days you can't. Some days it just feels impossible." Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has said that, at times, he "straight up wanted to die." The NBA's Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan shared their stories, too, while wide receiver Brandon Marshall - one of the first athletes to openly advocate for mental health awareness - has called that "the civil rights issue of our era."; no_fact;
no_fact; But he wrote that the question "what's wrong with me" dogged him during the "highs and lows" of his depression. Now Smith, who retired after the 2016 season, says he feels free "for the first time," crediting counseling for the change. "I've learned through hours and hours of counseling - and am still learning - so much about the battle I fight within," he wrote. "I find myself, as an extreme introvert defined by my counselor, looking for excuses on how to avoid large crowds and retreating during public appearances, big events and even family gatherings. Being in public is a constant struggle, not because I don't want to attract attention or think I'm 'important,' but because of my inner battle. "This is all proof that I still face my demons often, but I'm gradually learning how to cope with them," he went on. "How to understand them. And one thing has become abundantly clear: The best thing I ever did for my well-being was to seek help. I needed someone to help me comprehend how my mind deals with disappointment, grief, failure, etc.;

There's a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling.; If you think flying with a baby is easy, maybe you didn't hear about Krupa Patel Bala, who recently traveled from Sydney to San Francisco on United Airlines with her husband and 8-month-old son. Shortly after their baby began crying, a crew member confronted the family, seated in business class, and told them that his behavior was "absolutely unacceptable." The attendant claimed that babies weren't allowed to cry for more than five minutes on United flights, Bala says. "Parents of newborns have it hard enough already traveling with a baby," said Bala, who works for Facebook. "We certainly don't need crew managers piling on when we are doing our best to ensure we're containing our children and their cries." Bala used the onboard Internet to post her experience to Facebook. By the time her family landed in San Francisco, United was ready with an apology and a full refund. But they also underscored the unpleasant fact that no matter how you look at it, air travel with young kids is a challenge for everyone - including parents, other passengers and crew members. If there were a year for flying with infants, this probably wouldn't be it. With several high-profile incidents such as Bala's, and the continued absence of a regulation that would allow parents to sit next to their kids without paying extra, these are challenging times for babies on board. (In case you missed it, the Transportation Department has yet to issue a rule, as required by Congress, to ensure that a family that purchases tickets for a flight is seated together during that flight.) Most of this year's incidents started to gain notoriety when photos or videos were posted online, then spread to mainstream media outlets.;
no_fact; no_fact; For example, you probably heard about the child who used a training toilet on a plane. Or the woman who was booted from a flight for refusing to sit next to a crying baby and then threatening to have a flight attendant fired. So what do parents need to know about flying with babies? First, buy an extra seat. You'll need the extra space, and bringing the car seat on board will also make the trip safer for your offspring, experts say. "Typically a child is more comfortable in their own seat instead of being constantly readjusted in a parent's lap," says Ashanti Woods, an attending pediatrician at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore. Alexandra Fung, a mother of three and CEO of the parenting advice website Upparent.com, has a routine for every flight. Before boarding, she makes sure that her baby has a clean diaper and comfortable clothes that are easy to change, and is looking forward to the next meal. "Nurse or bottle feed during takeoff, as the swallowing motion will help with any discomfort from the pressure change, and a comfortable and well-fed baby might just spend the next couple of hours sleeping," she advises. When it comes to dealing with annoyed passengers, there are at least two schools of thought. Some of the experts say you should dress your baby in cute clothes to endear them to other passengers and hand out earplugs and treats with an "I'm sorry about my baby" note attached. Others subscribe to the "deal with it" philosophy: Just apologize if your baby cries too much and move on.;

Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling stock to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements that appear onscreen.; no_fact;

Apple Music has been gaining on Spotify in the domestic-subscriber market, closing the gap to within 3 million of  Spotify's 18 million subscribers last year, and may be on the way to passing it one of these days. Apple has also been beefing up its original video offerings, with talent such as Oprah Winfrey and Kumail Nanjiani, for what many analysts believe will be a combined music and video subscription service. [Instagram now has its own version of YouTube] So Spotify is returning the favor. The company wants to attract subscribers to its $10 monthly plan by offering not just access to 30 million songs but also original and licensed shows. Essentially, it's saying to Apple, "If you can gain subscribers with all this online music, we can win some of them back with video." It's a castling move in the long game of streamer chess. Incidentally, there's a bit of a parallel here to what another digital competitor, Google's YouTube, has been doing: hiring the veteran - yes, CW executive - Susanne Daniels to bring in new shows, such as the recent hit "Cobra Kai."

A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.; The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.;

no_fact; Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

no_fact; no_fact; The Carolina Panthers entered Sunday&rsquo;s game against the Redskins with one of the better rushing attacks in the NFL, but Washington held them to 81 total rushing yards, with 18 of those coming on a jet sweep by rookie wideout D.J. Moore.Quarterback Cam Newton and running back Christian McCaffrey were restricted to just 63 yards on 17 carries (3.7 yards per carry). That stat line should give the Redskins confidence as they game plan for Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott this week. However, given some of the hidden struggles of Washington&rsquo;s defense so far this season, and the ability of Dallas' running game, shutting down the Cowboys the way they did the Panthers will be no easy task.As impressive as the overall numbers were, what was maybe the biggest factor in the Redskins' success against Carolina&rsquo;s ground attack was simply game flow and how quickly they were able to take the Panthers out of their script. Carolina actually opened the game with a 9-yard McCaffrey run and three straight carries that gained 21 yards on the ground. Then they failed to turn 2nd and 2 into a first down and ended up punting the ball away from their own 47-yard line on 4th and 1.; A quarterback (commonly abbreviated "QB") is a position in American and Canadian football.

[Trade-happy Rams acquire cornerback Aqib Talib from Broncos] There was talk Friday about the possibility of Sherman re-signing with the Seahawks for contract terms more favorable to the team. Sherman was to count $13.2 million against the salary cap for the 2018 season as he entered the final season of a four-year, $56 million contract. Instead, the Seahawks save $11 million in cap space by releasing him. But usually when there is talk about a player re-signing with a team after being released, it ends up being just that: talk. Players and teams generally move on under those circumstances. Sherman hits the free agent market as a soon-to-be 30-year-old cornerback coming off a season shortened by a ruptured Achilles' tendon. That will make the market for him extremely interesting. He has been among the league's top pass defenders, able to change a game and alter an offense's approach by making it terribly risky to throw any passes in his vicinity. But can he still be that? [Without long-term deal, when will Steeers' Le'Veon Bell show up?] Teams will be interested, for sure. But will Sherman, now serving as his own agent, get the kind of contract offers he wants? It will be a significant story line. The Patriots, set to lose cornerback Malcolm Butler after his still-mysterious benching for the Super Bowl defeat to the Eagles, are a particularly intriguing possibility.;

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".; no_fact;

A young boy was listening closely, and maybe even picked up on Morris often rubbing his eyes, so he wondered if he had ever thought of quitting the NBA. Morris answered honestly.&ldquo;Actually, every day is an uphill battle,&rdquo; Morris said. &ldquo;Like, today I didn&rsquo;t feel like getting up and going and working out but I know that there&rsquo;s a draft every year and new players are coming in every single year no matter what.&rdquo;The NBA player shrugged.&ldquo;And I got to take care of my family. That&rsquo;s what I got to do,&rdquo; he said, before concluding, &ldquo;but I love it. That&rsquo;s the best thing about it.

It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.;

The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.;

And while they trust the coach, known for his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense, they adore Brady. "Brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of Patriots fans," Beneke said. "It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.;

His work often betrays a distinctly cruel disregard for audience comfort, bordering, at times, on sadism. "Happy End," for its part, signals a return to form for the director, who here makes a stark departure from the sweet tone of "Amour" - perhaps his most mainstream work - in favor of the vinegary outlook on life manifested in such films as "Funny Games," his 2007 horror movie about violently psychopathic home invaders, and "The White Ribbon," his 2009 pre-World War I period piece about, among other things, child abuse. Here, it's the child who's the monster, although Haneke finds bad behavior everywhere. Highlights of the action (if that's the right word) include incidents of marital infidelity via sexting and a beating - the last of which is delivered to Anne's son Pierre (Franz Rogowski) by the relative of a worker who has been seriously injured during an accident at one of the family's construction sites. But "Happy End" is not about family. Rather, it is about the human condition, especially as it has become degraded - or so the film argues - in an age of obsessive, digital self-regard and increasing social immobility.

The NCAA settled in a case concerning the dangers associated with head injuries in football. (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images) For a half-dozen years, courts across the country have handled a series of concussion-related lawsuits filed by former players and their family members, who felt football caused irreparable damage, sometimes even leading to death. The cases have been either settled, dismissed or are still locked in some stage of legal dispute. But Ploetz v. NCAA kept winding its way through the system and actually had a trial date. Finally, a judge and jury would hear arguments, and there might even be a decision that assigned liability for the trauma suffered on football fields. Since it was the first of its kind to go before a jury, the case grabbed the attention of players, families, leagues and helmet manufacturers that have been embroiled in concussion litigation. But Friday afternoon, on just the third day of the trial, the sides reached a settlement. Terms were not disclosed.; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact;
In opening statements, Ploetz's attorneys told the jury that the NCAA has known since the 1930s that football could lead to brain damage, according to Law360. The NCAA countered in court filings, saying Ploetz "voluntarily participated in the activity of playing football and accordingly assumed the risk of injury." The NCAA was represented by attorney Chris Watt, who told the jury in his opening statement Wednesday that the plaintiffs were engaging in "Monday morning quarterbacking," according to Law360. He also cast doubt on CTE, saying the condition is still not accepted in medical literature. (Two good primers on the case can be found here by Deadspin and here by Sports Illustrated.) Legal observers and advocates for former players had been watching Ploetz v. NCAA closely, certain it had the potential to set precedent and possibly lead to significant changes to football at the college level. The agreement certainly could be a positive one for Hardin-Ploetz. But Friday's settlement means the case probably will not bring about the broader-reaching judgment and public airing of evidence that many advocates had hoped for.;

One morning, while hunting for valuables along the beach with a metal detector, Dud finds a ring with the Lynx insignia. Through coinkydinks (and an empty gas tank), he knocks on the door of Lodge 49 and the show more or less begins. Dud is enchanted by the idea of the musty club, with its lingering air of secrets and rituals once kept by its members - throne rooms, inner sanctums, alchemy and pseudoscience. Now it's mainly a tavern for people who used to work at the nearby aerospace manufacturer, which is in its final stages of shutting down. The chapter's grand poobah, Larry (Kenneth Welsh), has been acting strangely, preparing his likely successor, Ernie (Brent Jennings), a plumbing-supply salesman, to take over. This necessitates an emissary from the Order of the Lynx's London headquarters to visit Lodge 49 and reassess its status. As "Lodge 49" sets up, viewers may find themselves anticipating more action.

no_fact; There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).;

The fear of snakes is hard-wired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains.; In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.;

Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called zoology.;
Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo. Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago. Nonetheless, in November 2018, scientists reported that nearly all extant populations of animals, including humans, may be a result of a population expansion that began between one and two hundred thousand years ago, based on genetic mitochondrial DNA studies. As such, humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a profound impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.; no_fact;

Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature  that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.Poetry has a long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys . Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE, while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, prosaic forms of writing.;

The Eagles' penalty margin was the fourth-worst during the regular season (minus-15) and their net penalty yard differential ranked 21st (minus-45) during the regular season. During the playoffs, Philadelphia has been penalized eight times for 79 yards while its opponents have been flagged six times for 87 yards, both half as much as New England during the postseason. 2017 NFL playoffs Penalties Penalty yards Opponent penalties Opponent penalty yards Patriots 5 47 16 160 Eagles 8 79 6 92 Having the penalty advantage is big, but having it in the Super Bowl is humongous.

Meanwhile, the Jaguars were assessed six penalties for 98 yards, two of which had a significant impact on the game. A 15-yard penalty on Jacksonville strong safety Barry Church for unnecessary roughness and a 32-yard defensive pass interference on cornerback A.J. Bouye during the next play led to the Patriots' first touchdown of the game. That, of course, set social media buzzing with suggestions the officiating crew was biased.

This is a risky move, because there's nothing that interests the bachelor less than drama in the house. Krystal continues to criticize the other women for being insecure, while her own insecurity drives her to pull Arie aside during the rose ceremony to anxiously test out how he's feeling and ensure him that she's here for the right reasons. This move did not endear her to her exasperated housemates, who make it clear that they want her to go home already. But Arie, still dazzled by Krystal, gives her a rose, along with Tia. Caroline is sent packing, in tears. And a preview of next week's episode showed that one contestant will say "Krystal is becoming a bit unhinged," so we have that to look forward to. The weirdest moment: Eating worms on the trail If you've been hiking for days and haven't had anything to eat, then I can see rummaging through the dirt for a wriggly snack or two. But the wilderness guide encourages the women to eat worms - and drink their own urine - before they've even stepped onto the trail and broken a sweat.

Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.; no_fact;
And while they trust the coach, known for his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense, they adore Brady. "Brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of Patriots fans," Beneke said. "It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures."

Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime.

no_fact; The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best-selling book of all time.Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.;

"I do want to know why we're here, where we're going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me." [In a tough sports town, baptisms and Bible studies fuel many of the Eagles' stars] For Chopra, son of best-selling spiritual writer Deepak Chopra and a devoted Boston sports fan, seeing sports as a religion makes sense. Both create community, have saints and rituals, and take place on hallowed ground. And - in a polarized nation - both can unite disparate groups of people, at least for a few hours. Sports might bring people together better than religion, said Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. "It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds," Wann said. "I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom." The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed: "In Bill We Trust," a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase "Do your job." Fans have bought in with near-religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. People invest a lot of hope in the team, Beneke said.;

During his first British visit, the president managed to offend everybody, from tabloid journalists to the queen. But although there are many incidents and relationships to choose from, the most embarrassing European foreign policy failure of the Trump administration is not unfolding in London or Brussels, but in Budapest. Why? Because in Budapest, the Hungarians are undermining the policies of the Trump administration by following its lead. In a recent speech, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that "our mission is to reassert our sovereignty." In addition, he said, "we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well." But "exerting sovereignty," by undermining NATO and other international norms and agreements, perfectly describes what Hungary is now doing - at the expense of the United States. For those who - understandably - don't follow Hungarian politics, let me preface this by explaining that Hungary is a de facto one-party state, led by a prime minister, Viktor Orban, who has stayed in power by exerting total control over all broadcast and print media in the country; by manipulating and gerrymandering elections; and by creating a network of corrupt oligarchs who finance him and his party.; no_fact;

Finally, and more famously, Hungary received international attention this week for forcing the Central European University - a U.S.-registered and -accredited institution, and one of the strongest universities in the region - to leave the country.

The decision was made after the government created legal problems for the university and ran another destructive poster campaign against the university's original founder, financier George Soros, who does not have a role in its current management. Talk of Soros was, once again, a fig leaf, a narrative designed to appeal to Hungarian anti-Semitism and the American right.

There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards is inspiring.; Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature  that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.Poetry has a long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys . Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE, while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, prosaic forms of writing.;

Over at Polygon, Julia Alexander explained recently that Ninja gained so many subscribers in a short amount of time that some in the streaming community suspected bots or some other trickery might be involved (Twitch, in a statement, said this theory wasn't true). Ninja's rise could also be explained by his incredible mastery of Fortnite, the game he streams most often. That game has also become extremely popular, very quickly. ... and what is Fortnite? Fortnite is the most popular competitive video game of the moment, created by Epic Games. It's a little bit like Minecraft in that a lot of the game-play involves breaking down and collecting resources to create fortifications against a zombie horde.; YouTube, LLC is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

no_fact; Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), known mononymously as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur. Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, "One Dance", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks. Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. Its lead single "Hotline Bling" received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song. In 2017, he released the mixtape More Life. Described by Drake as a "playlist", it became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and housed the number-one singles "God's Plan", and the bounce-infused "Nice for What" and "In My Feelings".;

"Streaming," when it comes to video games, just refers to playing them online through a livestreaming service. The people who do this are called "streamers." Twitch is the most popular of these platforms, but some use, say, YouTube or another service. Some streamers earn money as they play, through a combination of ads, sponsorships, merchandise sales and paid subscribers. Wait, people watch strangers play video games online?

These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel in the image, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are chemically "developed" into a visible image. The images on the film stock are projected for viewing the motion picture.;

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

Celebrity or the slang term celeb, refers to the fame and public attention accorded by the mass media to individuals or groups or, occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc.) themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention.Celebrity status is often associated with wealth (commonly referred to as fame and fortune), while fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.Successful careers in sports and entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status, while political leaders often become celebrities.People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person.; Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) (Ronald W. Erdrich/The Abilene Reporter-News via AP) Politicians come and politicians go, but the culture war is forever. That's the best way to understand a diverting little controversy happening now in Texas, the site of one of the most interesting Senate races this year. Sen. Ted Cruz is facing an unusually strong challenge from Rep. Beto O'Rourke, which is surprising in a state in which every statewide elected official is a Republican. O'Rourke seems to be surging thanks to charisma, relentless shoe-leather politicking, good timing and perhaps some viral videos of him straightforwardly defending progressive ideals and policies, like this one in which he explains why he supports National Football League players protesting police brutality. So now the Texas Republican Party is hitting back, including in a tweet featuring a shocking photo: The state GOP identified a rock star in a faded monochrome from the 1990s. A floral-print getup (perhaps a dress or tunic), cut wide at the neck, hangs over his lean frame. His hair is parted down the middle, the rest disappearing behind his head in what looks like a loose ponytail.; Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after Lebron James.;

Meanwhile, actual young people - the ones who decide what's cool and what isn't - can't stand the GOP. According to a recent NBC/GenForward poll, only 26 percent of millennials have a favorable impression of the Republican Party, while 60 percent have an unfavorable impression. (The numbers for the Democratic Party were 44 percent favorable and 42 percent unfavorable.) The saving grace for Republicans, however, is that young people vote at significantly lower rates than the older voters the GOP relies on. Or at least they usually do; we'll see if Democrats can finally change that this year. Either way, chances are we're going to keep having this fight for as long as we all live.;

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

no_fact; Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe, often without any locations, events, or people referencing the real world.Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became literature and drama.From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media, including film, television, graphic novels and video games.Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively, though these genres overlap.In popular culture, the fantasy genre is predominantly of the medievalist form.In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.; Ian Boyd is mobbed after his latest buzzer-beater, to beat U-Mass. on Saturday. (Rafael Suanes/George Mason University) Anyone who has ever bounced an orange sphere and lobbed it toward a metal hoop has dreamed of making a game-winning shot as the scoreboard clock flooded with zeros.

His reaction to back-to-back game-winners? "It doesn't strike me at all," he said with a shrug. "We've just got to keep playing, keep winning." Said Livingston: "He's a real humble person and player. So he doesn't let any of that stuff get to him. He's a hard worker. He's always going to be that way, no matter what." Asked to recount all of the buzzer-beaters that went in his team's favor during 24 years of college coaching, Paulsen scratched his head and stared at the ceiling of the practice gym. He came up with two: the 2003 Division III national semifinals when his Williams College squad defeated Wooster in overtime and, eight years later during his Bucknell tenure, when Mike Muscala (now with the Atlanta Hawks) caught a length-of-the-court pass and hit a turnaround jumper against Richmond. This season, Paulsen and the Patriots have enjoyed three stunners in 46 days. Before Boyd's heroics, Livingston made a last-gasp three-pointer from 28 feet to defeat that same Saint Joseph's team, 81-79, on Jan. 10 in Fairfax. "It builds confidence, knowing we can stay poised under pressure," Livingston said. "Next time we're in that situation, we know we can win the game." They won at Saint Joseph's when, with the game tied and 5.6 seconds left, Livingston dribbled across midcourt and encountered a roadblock. "I see two dudes running at Otis," Boyd said. "They tackled him, actually."; The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".; Google prefers dogs to cats. Their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company.; no_fact;

no_fact; In turn, an uptick in offensive efficiency should also be a big help for Delanie Walker, who last season became just the 14th TE to catch at least 70 passes while scoring as few as three TDs (per Graham Barfield of Fantasy Guru). Julio Jones, WR, Falcons Okay, he's never been an end-zone staple, having scored so many as 10 TDs in a season just once, but last year was ridiculous. Jones hit pay dirt just three times, despite otherwise turning 148 targets into 88 catches and 1,444 yards. Considering that he's working on a streak of four straight 1,400-yard seasons, Jones is likely to keep his yardage totals up, which means his TD total almost has to rise, and it's worth noting (as I did last month) that in his previous five healthy seasons, he averaged a respectable 7.6 TDs. Based on historical data, receivers that go over 1,400 yards in a single-season average 10.7 receiving TDs in that year.;
no_fact; Julio Jones failed to produce points in line with his draft position in 2017. (John Bazemore/Associated Press) On Thursday we examined four fantasy football stars from 2017 whose point totals appeared to be unsustainably high for a variety of reasons. But 2017 also featured several players who appeared to be a little snakebit last season and figure to have far more successful years in 2018 as their statistical averages progress to the fantasy scoring mean. [Four former fantasy football studs who should drop off in 2018] Here's a look at four prime candidates to bounce back: Marcus Mariota, QB, Titans Mariota slumped to just 13 TD passes in 2017, with 15 interceptions, after posting a 26:9 ratio the year before, but a bounceback could be in store. Mariota's TD percentage of 2.9 was not only far below the 5.1 and 5.8 he notched in his first two seasons, it was the worst of any QB who enters this season as his team's starter, apart from then-rookie Mitchell Trubisky (2.1). Not only should progression help Mariota, so should a coaching change that ousted head coach Mike "Exotic Smashmouth" Mularkey and offensive coordinator Terry Robiskie in favor of, respectively, Mike Vrabel and Matt LaFleur, the latter of whom comes over from the forward-thinking Rams.;

Julio Jones scored 3 this year. - Graham Barfield (@GrahamBarfield) January 1, 2018 DeVante Parker, WR, Dolphins Parker caught 57 passes for 670 yards over 13 games in 2017, but scored just once, which is fairly improbable for a 6-3, 220-pound receiver who theoretically should pose a problem for defenses on the red zone. As Pro Football Focus's Scott Barrett pointed out earlier this year, among 51 WRs who got at least 75 targets last season, Parker accounted for the NFL's lowest passer rating when targeted. That doesn't necessarily bode well for 2018, but it does leave a lot of room for improvement, and a QB switch back to Ryan Tannehill from Jay Cutler should help. [When to draft the top fantasy football rookies for 2018] Jay Ajayi, RB, Eagles Parker's former teammate was traded after seven scoreless games to Philadelphia, where in seven more games he scored just twice, including just once on the ground, this after scoring eight rushing TDs in 2016.;

Black mothers are at increased risk for many things, from preterm labor to maternal mortality, but Cardi B refuses to let the "what ifs" slow her down. Her hair length and color still change in almost every photo, her clothes are form-fitting yet stylish and she often communicates in sound words (Think: Okkkkkkkurrrr). It's refreshing to watch a woman, especially one of color, who is so free, both before and after announcing her pregnancy. That beautiful freedom should be celebrated, not scrutinized. By dancing on stage, Cardi B reminds us that pregnant women have just as much silliness and zest for life as they did before. She follows in the footsteps of women such as Ashley Wright, who did yoga and pole-danced through her pregnancy, and Meghan Leatherman, whose experience with CrossFit during her pregnancy inspired her to start CrossFit and Pregnant. Pregnancy might be a time of vulnerability, but it isn't necessarily a period of weakness. These women are embracing that idea. All pregnant women, regardless of race, just want the chance to exist and enjoy our lives in a world that tells us we only have value because we are carrying a life. Pregnancy doesn't change who you are.; no_fact;

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

For CBS, the stakes are high. The new "Murphy" is an attempt to get in on the revival trend that for the past year has had ABC ("Roseanne") and NBC ("Will & Grace") printing money with advertisers. There will be a raft of new material and tropes, Stormy and otherwise, for the show to work with. The nonstop nature of the Donald Trump-era news cycle nourishes the beast in a way the Bush I and Clinton years never could. If anything, the problem will be too many of those stories coming too fast. TV episodes tend to shoot as many as several months before they air; will the topics covered by Brown and "FYI" have that kind of shelf life? It's far from the only uncertainty for the new "Murphy.";

The Swedish Academy announced May 4 that no Nobel literature prize will be given in 2018 for the first time in more than six decades. (Reuters) Embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal, the Swedish Academy announced Friday that it will not award a Nobel Prize in literature in 2018. It has declined to award the prize seven times before, in years of war and when the academy determined that none of the nominees deserved it. The last time a Nobel literature prize was postponed was over six decades ago. "The Swedish Academy intends to decide on and announce the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2018 in parallel with the naming of the 2019 laureate," according to a statement posted on the Nobel Prize website. "The crisis in the Swedish Academy has adversely affected the Nobel Prize. Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the Nobel Prize." It added that the awarding of the other prizes would not be disrupted. The announcement came days after Swedish media reported that French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of an academy member and a recipient of academy funds, groped Swedish Crown Princess Victoria at an academy event in 2006.;
Literature, most generically, is any body of written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera: letter or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature), and non-written verbal art forms. Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature.; the father of the modern Olympics won one gold medal.

"The investigation revealed that unacceptable behavior in the form of unwanted intimacy had indeed taken place, but the knowledge was not widely spread in the Academy. Neither was the Academy aware of anything that might be described as criminal sexual assault," the Swedish Academy defended itself last Tuesday, even though it acknowledged that a letter containing detailed allegations about incidents at an associated organization in 1996 "was shelved and no measures taken to investigate the charges." "The reputation of the Nobel Prize in literature has suffered greatly from the publicity surrounding the Academy's crisis," the academy wrote. Nobel literature prizes usually boost sales of the winners' work, and some retailers fear that they will suffer under the delayed announcement of the 2018 winner. But close observers of the Swedish Academy's handling of the scandal said that the committee essentially had no other choice than to postpone this year's prize. "It would have been an insult to anyone who received it," Bjorn Wiman, a Swedish journalist, told the country's public radio.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).;

[British farmers worry: Who will pick the fruit after Brexit?] There have also been stories about a "sandwich famine" and the British Army - seriously - being deployed to suppress civil unrest. Last month, the British Sandwich Association warned a no-deal Brexit could affect the range of luncheon items on offer if it became harder to import out-of-season ingredients with a short shelf-life, like lettuce and tomatoes. It did not help matters that, on Thursday, the government itself also warned the 3,000 or so units of donor sperm from Denmark delivered to Britain each year might also be slowed down - as transports of human tissue and cells, in a no-deal scenario, would require new written agreements with the relevant E.U. licensed establishments. "Let me assure you that, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the army to maintain food supplies," said Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab after the release of 148 pages in 25 advisories, the first tranche of 80 documents on a possible no-deal world. But Thursday's advisories - even after being reportedly softened by the government - still conjure up a lot of hassle, added cost and dysfunction. In the past, May and her pro-Brexit cabinet repeatedly assured Britain a sweet deal with Brussels was just around the corner.;

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

That's not as 'Crazy' as it sounds.] Among the many powerful messages during last month's West Virginia teacher's strike, one woman was photographed holding a handmade sign that borrowed Johnny Cash's most famous couplet. "Students, Because You're Mine, I Walk the Line," it read, alongside a black-and-white portrait of the legend. There is no better illustration of the political efficacy of country music across generations. The CMA was right to belatedly release Mike Huckabee, but next they should embrace figures who speak proudly and forcefully for the many listeners who rely on this music for sustenance and inspiration in threatening political times.

Huckabee may be a longtime advocate for music education and the National Endowment for the Arts, a eulogist for George Jones and the host of a television show from Nashville, but these and other statements - including his recent dismissal of businesses who cut ties with the NRA as "cowardly" - certainly violate the CMA's own cautious positioning. More and more, however, that positioning is a hindrance to the organization. The Huckabee affair is the CMA's second 24-hour course correction in the past five months. When the CMA instructed reporters to "refrain from focusing ... on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like," artists' protest led them to rescind those guidelines the following day. The ceremony, held soon after the horrifying massacre of attendees at a Las Vegas country festival, ended up full of jokes and songs about contemporary politics. Maybe incidents like these will finally convince the CMA that neutrality is an impossible goal in a moment when the president himself has targeted whole countries and ethnicities for retribution. Such an aversion to politics and conflict is also unreflective of the genre's history: Country music has always thrived on and reflected cultural division. [I'm a white country singer.

Bill. Suddenly displaced, these men and their families sought out down-home comforts, including their beloved roadhouse bars and twangy sounds. A new breed of country musician emerged simultaneously, embodied by Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams. These performers used drums and electric instruments to be heard over the rowdy new venues, and their lyrics eschewed familiar pastoral and family themes. No more mama's-Bible and green-green hills: honky-tonk music, as it became known, was all about whiskey-scented heartbreak and workingmen's sorrows, the personal tolls of an uneasy new life apart from the land. The country industry evolved with its audience. The major record labels' first Nashville offices opened in the early 1950s, and soon the genre's whole financial and promotional apparatus settled in "Music City." Country music has been uneasily contradictory ever since: a tradition- and authenticity-obsessed genre mostly contained to a single cosmopolitan city, with its reigning popular styles forever swinging between glossy, commercial sounds and rougher-hewn ones. The genre has produced no shortage of politically explicit statements on current events, whether Loretta Lynn's "The Pill," about the liberating effects of birth control, or Garth Brooks's blandly utopian "We Shall Be Free."

The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

no_fact; Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humour. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.; Michael Caine became an actor because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.;

no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; In Game 1, according to the Synergy Sports, Golden State had 20 transition opportunities and Houston had 22. However, the Warriors were much more efficient, scoring 1.1 points per possessions compared with 0.73 for the Rockets, resulting in a 119-106 victory for Golden State. In Game 2, the Rockets had more possessions in transition, 23 to 16, and beat the Warriors, 127-105. On Sunday night in Game 3, the Warriors got the better of it in transition by far, 26 possessions to 12, and won by 41 points. Poor shooting by the Rockets only exacerbates the issue, allowing the Warriors to come up with the rebound and immediately go on the attack. Golden Sate decimated opponents in this way during the regular season and is doing so again in the playoffs, scoring 1.16 points per possession with a league-high effective field goal rate of 65 percent. In the playoffs, Durant alone is scoring 1.45 points per possession in transition, with Thompson (1.26, 81st percentile) and Curry (1.13, 56th percentile) each dangerous in his own right.;

Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.; the world record for speed reading is held by  Anne Jones, with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute; in the 18th century there was a "moral panic" because of the spread of the reading of novels.;

no_fact; no_fact; "Nevada Days," by Bernardo Atxaga (credit: Graywolf) For author Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Reno, Nev., was a city of new dreams and sprawling physical wonder, memorialized in his novel "The City of Trembling Leaves." Vladimir Nabokov found it less compelling, describing it as "a dreary town." The Reno of my youth contained plenty of both portrayals. It's a place of spiritual dissonance and contradictions, at once a high desert casino town and an aspirant city of culture. Old money comes from ranches and mines, new money from Tesla. I left at the age of 18 with the grace of a startled dog and it's stayed with me ever since. Home lingers in us all.

A number of Nevadans have cultivated a proud literature over the years, from Clark and Robert Laxalt to more recent offerings by Claire Vaye Watkins, Willy Vlautin and Caleb S. Cage. Celebrated Basque author Bernardo Atxaga now joins their ranks. His genre-blurring "Nevada Days" neither loves nor scorns Reno so much as mulls it over slowly, deliberately. Originally published in Basque and Spanish, it's a book of meditations that blends together travelogues and memories from Basque country with a dark exploration of fading American empire. What's hard fact? What's creative liberty? Atxaga's such an engaging witness, it doesn't matter.

. . . I was aware of a kind of vibration." The veneer of the detached visitor crumbles as he considers his young daughters and how easily a predator could reach their bedroom windows. He and his wife discuss the possibility of returning home early but decide to remain. The dread remains, too. "The vibration affected the whole city now." By the time Denison's murderer is arrested, the Atxagas have returned to Basque country - the same journey Laxalt made decades back in "Sweet Promised Land." "Nevada Days" serves as an inverse retelling of that western classic, and through the precision of Atxaga's language and the truths about Nevada and America he brings forth, it certainly meets the standard set by its predecessor. Its pages carry the smell of sagebrush and ring of slot machines, and will bring readers deep into its messy beauty. Matt Gallagher  is the author of the novel "Youngblood" and the memoir "Kaboom."

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

The company also has offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings jettisoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the DVD rental business. Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2012, debuting its first series Lilyhammer.; Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas any more because his beilef system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity;

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.;

no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.; baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises;

no_fact; The Ragamala Dance Company in "Written in Water," which the dancers will perform this weekend at the Kennedy Center. (Bruce W. Palmer) Hear the phrase "board-game-inspired movement" and you might think of a flourish with a chess piece, or a jubilant reach to place a Scrabble tile on a triple-word-score square. But the Ragamala Dance Company had more substantial physicality in mind for "Written in Water": The sensory-rich, idea-steeped work, which will be performed at the Kennedy Center this weekend, reflects, in part, a historical Indian version of the game Snakes and Ladders. "Written in Water," choreographed by co-artistic directors (and mother and daughter) Ranee and Aparna Ramaswamy, riffs on the conceptual and philosophical framework of Paramapadam, an Indian game whose players risk serpentine plunges while trying to ascend to a board's winning squares. Ranee and Aparna will be among the five dancers in the roughly hour-long work, which showcases the classical Indian dance style Bharatanatyam. During "Written in Water," illustrated-grid projections on the stage sometimes make the dancers appear to be pieces on a Paramapadam board. The illusion is infused with meaning, because the Indian snakes-and-ladders game - of which Paramapadam is one version - incorporates a morality-tale dynamic: The board's upper squares symbolize spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine, while the lower squares correspond to vices and spiritual degradation. Ascending ladders and downward-propelling snakes provide shortcuts.;

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style.

Although it entailed the biggest collection of Avengers (and Guardians of the Galaxy) on the big screen yet, bad guy Thanos was the real star of "Infinity War." A brilliant CGI performance from Josh Brolin showcased a calm and calculated ruthlessness never before seen in an antagonist of a Marvel Studios film. But the most brilliantly disturbing thing about Thanos is he doesn't see himself as the big bad. In his mind, he's the most merciful adversary of all-time: He is convinced the universe has gotten too big and the only way it can be saved is to cut it in half - literally.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

"You admit you've had work done," host Megyn Kelly asked Jane Fonda on Sept. 27 on NBC, "which I think is to your credit. But you look amazing. ... Why did you say - I read that you said you felt you're not proud to admit that you've had work done. Why not?" A perturbed Fonda non-responded, "We really want to talk about that now?" Fonda was on "Megyn Kelly Today" with Robert Redford to talk about their Netflix film "Our Souls at Night." "It was a movie about two old people that have an extraordinary relationship, and that doesn't come along that often," Fonda said in another interview. That brush-back was featured among the top exhibits as TV critics everywhere wrote about Kelly's troubles with ratings and a new format upon launching "Megyn Kelly Today" after a long career at Fox News. "Jane Fonda wasn't even the worst part of Megyn Kelly's terrible first week," ripped one headline on Kelly's transition. A moment like this - two celebs clashing on national television - doesn't just disappear. People keep it in the cultural rotation, as in this Variety interview, published over the weekend, in which Fonda said, "It wasn't like I was upset. I was stunned.;

Good retort, very journalistic. Then Kelly brought in her Fox News television incarnation. Here's how she laid things out: Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well, and she rejected it. That's okay. But I have no regrets about that question. Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage. Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam War. Many of our veterans still call her "Hanoi Jane" thanks to her radio broadcasts, which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an antiaircraft gun used to shoot down our American pilots. She called our POWs "hypocrites and liars" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it. By the way, she still says she's not proud of America. So the moral indignation is a little much.; Television (TV), sometimes shortened to tele or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in colour, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

Fonda was on "Megyn Kelly Today" with Robert Redford to talk about their Netflix film "Our Souls at Night." "It was a movie about two old people that have an extraordinary relationship, and that doesn't come along that often," Fonda said in another interview. That brush-back was featured among the top exhibits as TV critics everywhere wrote about Kelly's troubles with ratings and a new format upon launching "Megyn Kelly Today" after a long career at Fox News. "Jane Fonda wasn't even the worst part of Megyn Kelly's terrible first week," ripped one headline on Kelly's transition. A moment like this - two celebs clashing on national television - doesn't just disappear. People keep it in the cultural rotation, as in this Variety interview, published over the weekend, in which Fonda said, "It wasn't like I was upset. I was stunned.;

It was so inappropriate. It showed that she's not that good an interviewer." On show this Monday morning, Kelly kept things going. "When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business," said Kelly in a three-minute segment. "However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere. So it's time to address the poor-me routine." How "inappropriate" is it to ask about plastic surgery when you're talking to a woman who was promoting a film about aging? And what about all those other times when Fonda seemed only too happy to reflect on her plastic surgery? "She said the same to 'Entertainment Tonight,' " said Kelly, referring to Fonda's openness about her history. "To 'Access Hollywood.' To W magazine for a cover piece. To the Guardian. I could go on. Apparently when she came here, however - again, to promote her film about aging - I was supposed to discern that this subject was suddenly off-limits.";

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.; A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

the Sacramento Public Library started a "Library of Things" earlier this year, allowing patrons to check out, among other things, sewing machines and other items that patrons may find useful, but don't need to own long-term.; As such, Anderson's book fits in the growing movement among kid-lit writers to speak out more directly about social issues. Books such as "The Hate U Give," by Angie Thomas, and "Long Way Down," by Jason Reynolds, have led to frank conversations about violence and teens. The #MeToo movement has sparked authors to talk about sexual misconduct in their own ranks. The shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., spurred writers such as Raina Telgemeier toward greater activism. Anderson expects that "Shout" - aimed at high school students and up - will be challenged just as "Speak" still is by some readers who object to its unvarnished discussion of sexuality and violence. But Anderson, now 56 and a grandmother, is undaunted. "All of those teenagers were kind to talk to me," she says. "They educated me." She sees "Shout" as a kind of thank-you note to them and a "shot of advice about how liberating it is when you write about what you've been through." The message, she says, is simple: "I'll walk with you." Nora Krug is an editor and writer at Book World.;
Author Laurie Halse Anderson as a teen. In her upcoming book, she writes frankly about being raped at age 13. (Courtesy of Laurie Halse Anderson) Long before there was #MeToo, there was "Speak." Published in 1999, Laurie Halse Anderson's semi-autobiographical novel about rape was a bestseller and later a movie starring Kristen Stewart. It remains revered and controversial, appearing on high school curriculums across the country and on the American Library Association's most-banned-books list. Now Anderson is stepping up to the microphone again, this time with a little more anger and a little more candor. Her new book, to be published in March by Viking Children's Books, is called "Shout," and in it she writes not only about her own experience as a rape victim but also about the pain and heartache readers have shared with her in the two decades since "Speak" appeared. "Speak," by Laurie Halse Anderson (Square Fish) In the intervening years, Anderson has addressed untold numbers of young people - in schools and libraries across the country - about sexual assault. She has shared her own experience of being raped at 13, one year younger than the protagonist in "Speak," and how, like her, she kept silent about it. (Anderson waited 25 years before telling a therapist what happened to her.) Going public has turned Anderson into something of a confessor. "I have not spoken at an event where one or two people haven't come up to me in tears afterward," she said in a phone interview from her home in Philadelphia.; Author Laurie Halse Anderson. (Joyce Tenneson) "When I started 'Shout,' it was just my rage: Why can't we talk about these things?" she says. "Watching these brave people speak up as part of #MeToo just let me take the lid off, and that felt good. It was a second liberation for me." [A moment on 'Oprah' made her a human rights symbol. She wants to be more than that.] "Shout" is written in free verse. In the first half, Anderson shares her own experience and how it led to the writing of "Speak." The second half is what she calls a manifesto about "listening to and reflecting on a culture where sexual violence is rampant." The language is sometimes graphic and often empowering: We should teach our girls that snapping is OK, instead of waiting for someone else to break them.;

no_fact; Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.;

no_fact; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.; no_fact;

"He said 'Goodbye, Sissy,' and they went out to the car." Sooter posted a photo later that morning, showing Addy wearing a bright white sun hat.

Highs: Mid- to upper 90s. View the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters. FORECAST IN DETAIL The longest and hottest heat wave of the summer begins today and your body will not be happy. With little chance of cooling afternoon storms, please mindfully seek shade, replenish your sweat with water and electrolytes, and wear light-colored, lightweight, breathable clothing. The humidity isn't awful but will build through Sunday and early next week, resulting in heat indexes of 100 to 105, near-dangerous levels. Listen to the latest forecast: Get our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how. Today (Friday): High temperatures for the start of our heat wave eye the 90- to 95-degree range. With merely subtropical dew points in the 60s, heat index values shouldn't exceed the mid-90s. Just a few clouds would be nice in this instance but sunshine looks to dominate. If you're lucky, you'll feel a quick northwesterly breeze around 5 mph - for a moment. Confidence: High Tonight: A few, periodic clouds are possible, and haze may start to slowly become visible as that humid feeling slowly increases. That's more water vapor moving in.;
no_fact; no_fact;
Confidence: Medium-High A LOOK AHEAD Sunday: Heat index values around 105 degrees are possible, so please be careful. Oppressive mugginess and heat look probable, with high temperatures in the mid- to upper 90s possible. Still-sunny skies with little to no prospect for cooling afternoon thundershowers means: oof! Confidence: Medium-High Sunday night: More clear skies than not, albeit with a little haze. The entire region hovers in the muggy 70s again by just before dawn (maybe even only near 80 downtown) - and it will take the entire night to get that "cool" so you may want to keep the air conditioning on all night. Hang in there! Confidence: Medium-High Oppressiveness continues with heat index values in the 100-105 range likely Monday and Tuesday. Perhaps reaching just a bit, there is a slight signal that we see a few more clouds and perhaps a passing (cooling!) thundershower later, both days. Fingers crossed. Low 90s with a heat index around 100 possible with a few clouds and showers. Mid-90s with a heat index around 105 more likely if it stays rain-free and sunny. Confidence: Medium; no_fact; no_fact;
no_fact;
no_fact; Temperatures settling around 70 outside the Beltway, to perhaps mid-70s downtown, are about the best we can dip to, for pre-dawn low temperatures. Winds quickly drop from very light to nearly calm after sunset. Confidence: Medium-High  For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through into next week. Tomorrow (Saturday): Sunshine continues to dominate over any periodic (merciful?) clouds. It feels a half-notch warmer thanks to dew points heading too close to the tropical 70-degree mark. High temperatures may add a couple degrees but stay roughly in the low- to mid-90s. The heat index could top out around 100 degrees. Very light south-southwesterly breezes may not offer much refreshment. Confidence: High Tomorrow night: A few clouds may bubble up again, helping to buoy temperatures (unfortunately) like an insulating blanket in the atmosphere. Low to mid-70s are as low as we get, and thanks to fairly tropical dew points around 70 degrees, the air conditioning may need to stay on most of the night.;

Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.; no_fact;

Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "action" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek: δράω, drao).

They, too, are lovingly celebrated for their quirks and unusual sensibilities. The paper ghosts in Feldman's photos haunt this journey but are sometimes no match for the narrator's spooky ruminations: "I imagine how it would feel to stop the truck, pull my gun out of the console, and shoot him in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert. I'd watch his blood land like black raindrops on the dark leather. It could be the most satisfying second of my life - the price maybe being every single second afterward." Every journey reaches its end, and the one in "Paper Ghosts" comes on fast and furious. Signposts along the way warn of angst, secrets and deadly plot twists, but you'll never see what's coming. You'll step out of this fictional vehicle feeling like you've been T-boned by an 18-wheeler. Carol Memmott is a writer based in Northern Virginia.

Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, created by George Lucas and centered around a film series that began with the eponymous 1977 movie. The saga quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon.The first film was followed by two successful sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983); these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was released between 1999 and 2005, albeit to mixed reactions from critics and fans. Finally, a sequel trilogy to conclude the nine-episode saga began in 2015 with The Force Awakens. The first eight films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful, with a combined box office revenue of over US$8.5 billion. Together with the theatrical spin-off films The Clone Wars (2008), Rogue One (2016), and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film series of all time.The film series has spawned into other media, including books, television shows, computer and video games, theme park attractions and lands, and comic books, resulting in significant development of the series' fictional universe. Star Wars holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise". In 2018, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at US$65 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise.; no_fact; no_fact;

icials in ancient Athens were appointed by lottery because they believed elections would lead to an oligarchy.; An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).;

no_fact; Few moons in the solar system are as intriguing as Jupiter&rsquo;s moon Europa. A global ocean of salt water almost certainly surrounds the moon &mdash; and it holds more water than any ocean on Earth. Above this immense sea, where surface temperatures dip to minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit, a crust of water ice forms a shell. Astronomers predict that Jupiter, which bombards the moon with intense radiation, causes the entire moon to groan with gravity&rsquo;s tug. Europa&rsquo;s liquid water is a tempting target for future missions looking for possible alien microbes.But before a future lander can search for microscopic E.T., the probe might have to contend with a forest of tall, jagged ice spikes. So argues a team of planetary scientists and geomorphologists Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Their research suggests Europa is an icy hedgehog world, covered in ice formations rarely found on Earth.On our planet, ice takes several forms, as varied as needle ice, rime, parking lot slush and more exotic lumps. But because Europa&rsquo;s surface is &ldquo;incredibly cold,&rdquo; said Daniel Hobley, a geomorphologist at Cardiff University in the U.K., an author of the study, ice will not melt and refreeze.Instead, stranger things happen. Ice is not perfectly flat &mdash; it&rsquo;s made of little crystals. &ldquo;Each of those crystals has potential to lens light,&rdquo; Hobley said, channeling or refracting light down into ice.;

there is evidence of Methane based life on Titan, a moon of Saturn.; The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth and is Earth's only permanent natural satellite.The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.After the Sun, the Moon is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky.The Moon's average orbital distance is 384,402 km (238,856 mi), or 1.28 light-seconds.The Moon's apparent size in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar distance and diameter.This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.Both the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial.;

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.; no_fact;

no_fact; After weeks of talk about remaining calm during a month-long slide, the Navy football team hit a new low Saturday that finally seemed worthy of some fright. Each loss in Navy's streak has been punishing in its own way. Against SMU, there was the sting of a last-second overtime loss. Air Force brought an all-consuming hurt known only to those who play for service academies. Temple was a rare home loss surrendered in a game the Midshipmen had control over for a long while. But Saturday's 49-36 loss to Houston was a different kind of blow. It marked Navy's first four-game losing streak since a six-loss spell in the middle of the 2011 season. What's more, with No. 4 Notre Dame, one-loss Cincinnati, No. 10 Central Florida and Army looming as four of the Mids' six remaining games, it seriously endangered the Midshipmen's chances at bowl eligibility. [College football winners and losers: Sooners defense, better late] Coach Ken Niumatalolo was beyond alarm after the game. He was fiery after the loss to Temple last week, but Saturday he kept his voice low and spoke with an air of defeat. The 11th-year head coach said he has no answers for why Navy (2-5, 1-3 American Athletic Conference) can't put together more than one good half of football, nor any explanation for why it can't avoid what he calls self-inflicted wounds. "It's just inexplicable things. It's not like they changed the defense . .; no_fact;
no_fact; . so it wasn't like they did something new and I'm like, 'Oh wow, what do we do?' " Niumatalolo said. "I don't know. If I knew, obviously we would be doing it." Niumatalolo often preaches that the margin of error is slim at Navy, where recruits generally aren't as big, fast or strong as Division I players at civilian schools. He was asked Saturday whether the margin of error for this year's team is even smaller. "We're not playing as well. That's obvious," he said. "We're just doing things that we normally don't do, critical errors that we normally don't do. We're not playing Navy football. Normally when people beat us, they beat us. But we've had way too many missed assignments . . . and that always comes back to me, the head coach.;

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".; no_fact;

The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker.; Rock is just functioning at a lower gear than hip-hop, and it's forfeiting its chance to contemporaneously weigh in on this strange era. Years from now, it will be difficult to pinpoint any single guitar-driven song that speaks to the ugliness that has infected much of modern life in the age of Trump, yet a here-today-gone-tomorrow dispatch by a little-known artist such as Saba will home in on the disenfranchisement of black men with blunt intensity: "They want a barcode on my wrist / To auction off the kids that don't fit their description of a utopia/ Like a problem won't exist if I just don't exist." The irony, of course, is that rock was once the most powerful delivery system for social commentary and protest that American culture had ever produced - it's the music that invented the teenager, lit a fuse under antiwar and and human rights movements, gave us a rich tradition of anti-what-have-you insurrection. For every Pete Townshend windmill slammed across the strings of his Les Paul, there was also the Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again" and "Baba O'Riley," sharp stabs at a crumbling social order - at least until they were rubbed smooth and became stadium anthems leached of their original intent. At its best, rock opens an aperture into new ways of thinking about the personal and the political; but in its present state, it's a black mirror, reflecting nothing. Until rock musicians can figure out new ways to tap into the way we live now, and dissect the psyche of a fractious, angry and fearful country, hip-hop will remain the only genre that matters.;

no_fact; Constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain; Marc Weingarten is a former contributing writer for Vibe, Rolling Stone and Spin, and the author of "Thirsty: William Mulholland, California Water and the Real Chinatown." No one who has heard Kendrick Lamar's stunning album "Damn" could be at all surprised that it is the first nonclassical or jazz recording to win a Pulitzer Prize. More than that, it is further proof - if any is still needed- that American culture has at last fully moved beyond the hegemony of rock-and-roll and the electric guitar-driven sound that dominated 60 years of popular music. The Pulitzer for Lamar might confuse or anger those reared on the great canon of rock, but perhaps we will no longer have to endure the cloudy reveries of middle-aged men bemoaning the fact that fewer people seem to appreciate the brilliance of a 20-minute Clapton or Hendrix solo anymore. Didn't millions of us, after all, live out our arena-rock fantasies with the Guitar Hero video game just a few years ago? Mercifully, rock has been displaced by hip-hop, with its daring formal innovations, its blistering polemics and its vital role as a sounding board for powerful social movements. A genre aggressively committed to singles, as opposed to the creaky album-and-tour model that rock stubbornly insists upon even at the indie level, hip-hop provides a running commentary on the culture as it happens - a musical newsfeed in real time.; no_fact; Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" is the best-selling album of the 21st century.;

"Please tell your sons that they ARE welcome here, even if they don't feel like it." A police report and audio of the 911 call were redacted and edited to avoid identifying the caller, who was described as a white female. During the 911 call, the woman repeatedly told the dispatcher that she had never called 911 on anyone before and, perhaps, she was just "being completely paranoid." After the incident, Lorraine Gray called campus police and told the officer that she felt her sons had been racially profiled, according to the police report. The officer told Gray that police are obligated to follow up on any call they receive and that the caller was "suspicious because of the boys' actions alone." But in his message to the campus community, Frank, the president, urged everyone to reflect on their own biases against people who don't look like them. "It seems to me that we can all examine our conscience about the times in our own lives when we've crossed the street, avoided eye contact, or walked a little faster because we were concerned about the appearance of someone we didn't know but who was different from us," he said. And that call for self-reflection includes him, Frank said, "a white man in a position of authority." Kyle Swenson contributed to this report.;

Later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.

(Western Cape Department of Social Development) He is believed to have outlived every other man on Earth, though the Western Cape Department of Social Development said in a statement that he has "yet to be recognized by the Guinness World Records organization." In April, Guinness World Records named Japan's Masazo Nonaka the oldest living person (male). Nonaka, 112, from Ashoro, Hokkaido, assumed the title from a man in Spain, who died this year at the age of 113. But it is France's Jeanne Louise Calment who holds the Guinness record for the "oldest person ever." The woman, from Arles in southern France, was 122 when she died in 1997. Guinness World Records said Blom is not being considered for an award. "We receive many applications from individuals who claim to be the oldest living person (male or female) and see many reports about such individuals," a Guinness World Records spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday to The Washington Post. "However, we ask for a great deal of paperwork and proof to substantiate claims that meet our official guidelines.;

no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

no_fact; Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack.

A scientist is someone who conducts scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.In classical antiquity, there was no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.In modern times, many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.;

Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension.Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated.The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement.Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations.Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of speech) and comprehension.Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words.Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or schema.The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).; Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches;

But Japan advanced to the knockout round despite the loss. Colombia's simultaneous 1-0 victory over Senegal in Samara meant that fair play points determined whether Senegal or Japan would advance as Group H's runner-up. Senegal and Japan finished level on points, goal differential and goals scored, and they drew in their head-to-head meeting. But Japan advanced because it was assessed two fewer yellow cards than Senegal. Colombia won the group by prevailing in its final two games after its opening loss to Japan. Japan will face Group G's winner, either Belgium or England, in the round of 16 on Monday in Rostov-on-Don.

no_fact; World War II looms over the teens of Riverdale in "Archie 1941." Cover illustrated by Peter Krause. (Archie Comics) The past few years at Archie Comics have been about embracing the future with new types of storytelling and visual style. By not being limited to their classic and cartoony look - though it's still a big part of Archie Comics in various titles - the longtime comics publisher is able to embrace new ways of presenting the Archie universe to the world, from groundbreaking characters (Kevin Keller), to horror ("Afterlife with Archie") to the hip (Mark Waid and Fiona Staples's "Archie") to television (the CW's "Riverdale"). Now, Archie Comics is applying that same approach to the past. "Archie 1941" debuts Wednesday in print and digitally. The five-issue miniseries will look at the lives of Archie and his pals as they graduate from high school and enter into a real world that is on the brink of World War II. No stranger to writing daring and different Archie adventures is veteran comics scribe Mark Waid, who will co-write "Archie 1941" with Brian Augustyn. Peter Krause will illustrate. "[We wanted] to combine the familiarity of Archie and his gang with the genuine feel of the era rather than a cartoon feel," Waid told The Washington Post's Comic Riffs. Though teen goofball Archie Andrews and his pals first appeared in Pep Comics in December 1941, the same month as the attacks on Pearl Harbor that led the United States to enter into the Second World War, those tales never embraced what was actually happening during that era.; no_fact;

Republicans appear to have lost nearly 35 House seats, seven governorships, more than 225 state legislative seats and six legislative chambers. And Republicans' House losses would be higher if not for gerrymandering. Trump's victory claims rest on Republican gains of a few Senate seats - an artifact of a political map friendly to Republicans, not popular will. The latest popular-vote tally for the Senate, though distorted by the absence of a Republican candidate in California, shows Democrats leading Republicans by 12.5 million votes. Voters turned out at near-presidential levels. Of the two-thirds of voters who said Trump was a factor in their votes, most said they were voting to oppose him. And yet, asked Wednesday "what lesson did you learn most" from the election results, Trump replied: "I think people like me." In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, after the Democratic takeover of the House had become official, Trump retweeted a message saying "Trump is the magic man." And he is! Trump made three dozen Republican House seats disappear, sawed his party's advantage in governorships in half and caused six legislative chambers to escape from Republican control - while pulling one racist canard after another out of his hat about invading hordes of migrant criminals. Most troubling: Trump is acting as though he actually believes the midterms were a triumph. His sacking of Sessions suggests he thinks he can get away with anything - even ousting Mueller - with impunity.;

In 2018, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at US$65 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise.; 20th Century Fox, convinced that Star Wars was going to flop, agreed to George Lucas’s proposition to forgo an additional $500K directing fee in return to keep licensing and merchandising rights for himself. This decision cost Fox billions and made George Lucas a Billionaire.;

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

no_fact; Cinematography (from ancient greek κίνημα, kìnema  "movement" and γράφειν, gràphein "to write") is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film stock.Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside a movie camera.Images captured with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are chemically "developed" into a visible image.The word "cinematography" is based on the Greek words κίνημα (kinema), meaning "movement, motion" and γράφειν (graphein) meaning "to record", together meaning "recording motion".The word used to refer to the art, process, or job of filming movies, but later its meaning became restricted to "motion picture photography".;

Chinese American James Wong Howe was an Oscar-Winning cinematographer who pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography. He was not an American citizen until 1943 and his marriage with a white woman was illegal until 1948 due to racism.; I built the puzzle around a soldiers-only gentlemen's club, which provided the closed environment and limited suspects that the old Golden Age mysteries thrived on. It also gave me the opportunity to delve into wartime trauma: Shell shock, or what we call PTSD today, was a known but poorly understood aspect of life after World War I. Most Golden Age writers touched on it only briefly, if at all, but I had a century's worth of distance and medical advancement on my side. I had my puzzle, and I'd set my stage. All that remained was my detective. I wanted someone who was sympathetic and human, rather than a superhero whose preternatural prowess the reader could only admire from afar. Like any writer, I looked within, which is how Eric Peterkin went from being a white European to being a Eurasian born to a British father and a Chinese mother - or, to use a period slur, a "half-caste." I had my doubts when I made that decision. Ethnically speaking, I'm all Chinese, and I grew up in Singapore, where 75 percent of the population is ethnically Chinese. But the effects of 160 years of British rule continue to be felt in Singapore. Growing up in an English-speaking family, I felt a certain Britishness that went beyond the dog-eared Christie at the bottom of my school bag. There was social pressure to remember my Chinese identity - to never forget who I was or where I'd come from.;

Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.; no_fact;

no_fact; That simplicity led to a remarkable run of charting singles that included a more aggressive 1964 surf remake of "Walk, Don't Run." While their twangy, reverb-drenched guitars and rumbling drums helped launch the surf-music craze, the Ventures did not consider themselves a surf band. They established their versatility on such concept albums as the eerie "The Ventures in Space" (1964), the mod-influenced "Wild Things!" (1966) and the psychedelic "Guitar Freakout" (1967). They recorded movie and television themes - "The Fugitive," "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue," -"Secret Agent Man" - and sustained their career with instrumental covers of contemporary hits. An original by Bogle and Mr. Edwards, "Surf Rider" (1961), was featured in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film "Pulp Fiction." The Ventures also recorded several instruction albums for bass, guitar and drums, all with accompanying books. One such album, "Play Guitar with the Ventures," managed the unlikely feat of placing on the Billboard album charts in 1965. Their most enduring popularity was not in the United States but in Japan. They first toured there in 1961 and were astonished to learn on subsequent trips that they had spawned a legion of imitators. "There are so many groups like the Ventures that they even try to call themselves something close to the name," Mr. Edwards told the Los Angeles Times in 1996. "The Yokohama Ventures, the Venturas - anything to get close." Mr. Edwards had two tours of duty with the Ventures - during their initial popularity from 1959 to 1968 and from 1973 to 1984.;

no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding.The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs".A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century.In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central.;

She sent voters a four-page mailer that touts her ability to get "conservative results for Virginia," as well as endorsements from John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; and the National Rifle Association. It also says she is "pro-border wall to stop illegal immigration," "pro-life," and "pro-2nd Amendment." In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Pence recorded a phone message urging voters to cast ballots for his "friend" Comstock, whom he called "a strong, effective, conservative leader," according to Comstock's spokesman Jeff Marschner. Last week, she trumpeted the support of her longtime friend David Bossie, chairman of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United and Trump's 2016 deputy campaign manager. Hours later, Hill's campaign hosted a "pro-Trump Meet and Greet" with a special guest: Fox News contributor and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka. The winner of the GOP primary will face the winner of the six-way Democratic contest, which will also be decided Tuesday. Then the question becomes whether the Republican can overcome Trump's unpopularity in the district, which includes parts of Fairfax and Prince William counties, all of Loudoun County and a rural swath to the west. Three independent analysts consider the race a "toss-up.";

"And since Comstock faces a greater threat in November than in June, it makes sense to focus on the problems of her Republican opponent." Her primary strategy shows she's "threading the needle" by attacking Hill in ways that won't undermine her chances in November, he said. Comstock's campaign defended the approach. "Like in every other of our winning campaigns, we are sprinting through the finish line," her campaign manager, Susan Falconer, said in a statement. "Shak Hill is an unvetted, perennial failed candidate who isn't who he claims to be. It's long past time to inform people of his past." Later, lawyers from her campaign petitioned a radio station to stop airing an ad from Hill that they argue falsely claims Comstock knew the identities of members of Congress who privately settled claims of sexual misconduct, suggesting that she was complicit in keeping their behavior shrouded in secrecy. During the past year, Comstock has been one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill calling for reforms to the process for reporting sexual harassment.

But the mother throwing the party was not just another loving parent. She was the wife of the biggest name in drug trafficking. As first reported by the Los Angeles Times this week, Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of alleged Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaqu?n "El Chapo" Guzm?n, posted the images from the 7th birthday party for the couple's twin daughters. The images drew the usual social media rubbernecking but also outrage. Awaiting trial in U.S. custody, Guzm?n is alleged to have run a vicious billion-dollar narcotics empire that had nearly complete control of the American illegal drug supply and left behind a significant body count. But as the alleged kingpin stews in a cell, his wife is hosting parties with the blood money. "You know that this was not possible without who knows how many deaths and tortures in Mexico, right?" one poster commented in Spanish under Coronel's party pictures.

The romance between Guzm?n and Coronel runs straight back to Sinaloa, where Guzm?n's criminal escapades have made him a folk hero.;

Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.; no_fact; In &ldquo;Life in the Garden,&rdquo; she recalls with great clarity her own ostensibly ordinary but deeply formative environments.She remembers hiding places in her childhood garden in Cairo, where she would read, near a eucalyptus tree or in a hedge or by a bamboo shaded water garden teeming with tadpoles. &ldquo;I can still draw a map of this garden in every detail,&rdquo; she writes,&rdquo; though it has long been displaced by urban sprawl. When she later visited the area that loss could not erase &ldquo;a memory of trees and grass and flowers, and the ghost of my own alter ego.&rdquo; This introduction seems to herald what the reader hopes to be a cozy memoir of a long life shaped, enriched and decorated by garden experiences. But the narrative soon breaks free of this leash and we are led on a journey where the path seems not just winding but at times aimless. [Dig into these gorgeous books for gardening inspiration]There are moments of poignant observation.

One chapter, called Reality and Metaphor, encompasses everything from the gardening dynamic between Virginia and Leonard Woolf to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to gardens as subjects by artists as varied as Monet and Munch. This may be gently didactic for readers with no gardening background. If you are even mildly versed in such topics as Tulipomania, the English landscape style, the creation of Sissinghurst Castle Garden, it seems cursory and, in the absence of stronger connecting threads, actually quite tedious.More engaging are Lively&rsquo;s reminiscences of her personal life. After an exotic and colorful start to life in the colonies, the writer settled into what seems a comfortable and genteel English middle class existence back in Blighty, which is to say one never too far from the garden and, moreover, the act of gardening.&ldquo;The two central activities in my life &mdash; alongside writing &mdash; have been reading and gardening,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;And there has been a sense in which the two have meshed: I always pay attention when a writer conjures up a garden, when gardening becomes an element of fiction.&rdquo;Lifelong gardeners will nod along as she writes about succumbing to plant fads.; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning.

In &ldquo;Life in the Garden,&rdquo; she recalls with great clarity her own ostensibly ordinary but deeply formative environments.She remembers hiding places in her childhood garden in Cairo, where she would read, near a eucalyptus tree or in a hedge or by a bamboo shaded water garden teeming with tadpoles. &ldquo;I can still draw a map of this garden in every detail,&rdquo; she writes,&rdquo; though it has long been displaced by urban sprawl. When she later visited the area that loss could not erase &ldquo;a memory of trees and grass and flowers, and the ghost of my own alter ego.&rdquo; This introduction seems to herald what the reader hopes to be a cozy memoir of a long life shaped, enriched and decorated by garden experiences. But the narrative soon breaks free of this leash and we are led on a journey where the path seems not just winding but at times aimless. [Dig into these gorgeous books for gardening inspiration]There are moments of poignant observation. While &ldquo;gardening,&rdquo; she notes, &ldquo;you are no longer stuck in the here and now.&rdquo; She adds that &ldquo;there is this abiding astonishment at the fury for growth, at the tenacity of plant life, at the unstoppable dictation of the seasons.&rdquo; Indeed, time is the dimension every true gardener sees working in concert with a plant&rsquo;s own primal force.;

The 1987 novel won the Booker Prize and is now shortlisted for the Golden Man Booker Prize, an award for the best title in the prestigious competition&rsquo;s first half century.

no_fact; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning.

Monarchs are renowned for their annual journey, often thousands of miles, to Mexico, and for their multi-generational trip back to the northern United States and Canada. She put a picture of the broken wing on Facebook, and a friend sent her a step-by-step tutorial video that showed how to fix it. McCloskey said she didn't hesitate. "Because of the work I do, it was no-brainer," said McCloskey, who is a master embroiderer by trade, mostly doing work for independent films through her company, Faden Design Studios. She took out the tools she needed: tweezers, small scissors, glue, a wire hanger, a towel and talcum powder. She also had a spare wing from a butterfly that had died days earlier. She had kept the butterfly thinking it was beautiful and that she might display it in a shadow box on her wall. But instead, she said she found a better use for it. A migrating monarch - which can live for several months - doesn't have nerve endings in its wings, so she wasn't concerned about hurting it.;

A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot while the wearer is doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing.;

Constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain; Daniel Craig in Berlin in 2015. (Michael Sohn/Associated Press) Being a moviegoer used to be easy. You'd see a trailer for the new "Star Wars" or James Bond flick, get excited, maybe read a review or an interview with the director in your local paper, and then you'd go see the movie. End of transaction. All you would know of the casting process is who ended up in the movie. You would remain ignorant of any behind-the-scenes drama between the filmmakers and the studio, unless something truly bizarre happened and a documentary was made a la "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse," which tells the insane story of the disastrous production of "Apocalypse Now." Well, the times, they are a-changin'. Now audiences watch - and often weigh in on - the entire filmmaking process as it plays out through news reports and social media postings. And that's exactly what's happening with the 25th installation in the James Bond franchise. Few movies demonstrate the sheer public nature of today's blockbuster-making process better than the unreleased movie. Cary Fukunaga, who became a household name for stylishly directing all eight episodes of the first season of HBO's "True Detective," was announced as the movie's director on Thursday. Daniel Craig, meanwhile, will reprise his role as Bond. There are a few notable things about Fukunaga helming the project. He's the series' first non-British director. His art-house style has ruffled feathers, most notably those belonging to Nic Pizzolatto, the creator and writer of "True Detective.";

Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically-successful class of tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species, more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

Ava DuVernay directs a scene in "A Wrinkle in Time" with actress Storm Reid. DuVernay will reportedly direct a "New Gods" movie for Warner Bros./DC Entertainment. (Disney) Darkseid is ... under the direction of Ava DuVernay. The "A Wrinkle in Time" director will reportedly direct the film version of "New Gods," one of DC Comics' most cherished properties, created by comic book legend Jack Kirby in 1971. The "New Gods" universe features some of DC Comics' most popular characters outside of its famed Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman trinity, including Darkseid, his son Orion and Mister Miracle. In December, DuVernay hinted at her interest in "New Gods" as she tweeted that Big Barda was her favorite superhero. On Thursday, she tweeted a photo of Kirby. Gosh, that's hard. Big Barda.; no_fact; no_fact;
Whether that was an intentional move by DC against its rival is hard to say, but surely DC has to be happy with the (for now) positive movie news trending online. Any live-action "New Gods" movie would be an expensive, CGI-heavy production, two facets with which DuVernay is very familiar after directing "A Wrinkle in Time" for Disney. A "New Gods" movie represents the type of bold decision-making that shows WB/DC will not let previous failures and polarizing films stop them from trying to return to their glory days of superhero movie making. The DC Extended Universe has seen other hopeful signs recently. Patty Jenkins's "Wonder Woman" was a hit and has led to a soon-to-be-in-production sequel, and there's the hope that James Wan's "Aquaman" (starring Jason Momoa and coming to theaters this November) will have the same impact. "Shazam!" is in production (starring Zachary Levi), but so far leaked photos aren't inspiring much fanboy approval. WB/DC is likely hoping DuVernay can boom-tube them in the right direction and that the "New Gods" can give them a new classic.;

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe.The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.;

Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; no_fact;

Although James is extremely athletic and talented, he still has room for improvement as a run defender and in coverage. James's talent is best utilized in an active, attacking capacity in a robber role or near the line of scrimmage where he can support the run, blitz and handle physical coverage responsibilities. NFLDraftScout.com's Rob Rang: A movable chess piece with experience at safety, linebacker and cornerback, James might just be the most versatile defender in the 2018 NFL draft. He offers a combination of instincts, athleticism and prototypical size that scouts will find alluring, earning an early first-round grade - perhaps even a spot in the top 10. Scouts also will have to weigh in the fact that James's best season - at least from a statistical standpoint - came three years ago and that he does come with some durability concerns. He missed virtually the entire 2016 season with a torn meniscus and opted to sit out the 2017 Independence Bowl to avoid injury after announcing his decision to enter the draft with two years of eligibility remaining. [Who should the Redskins draft? : Lamar Jackson vs. Derrius Guice] The breakdown: Payne The 6-2, 311-pounder brings pure strength and good athleticism to the defensive line. He's an elite run stopper who starred in Alabama's national championship victory. His 53 tackles in 2017 ranked sixth on the Crimson Tide. Payne ran the 40-yard dash in 4.95 seconds to rank 12th among defensive linemen. He was named second-team All-SEC in 2017. The Redskins should have some inside knowledge from former Alabama teammate Jonathan Allen, who played alongside Payne in 2015 and 2016. The criticism centers on if Payne can add much of a pass rush in the league.

I think he's got a little bit of stiffness in his ankles, that's one of the only knocks I had on him. But he plays hard and he's a really intriguing player. I think he's got a little more to offer as a pass rusher. NFL Network analyst Bucky Brooks: It really depends on which Da'Ron Payne shows up on your doorstep. He's talented, we saw him dominate throughout the College Football Playoffs. Not only against the run, but also with consistent presence as a pass rusher.

Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.;

no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

"My assistants said to me, 'You ever see someone do that one-on-one?' I said, 'Yeah, Muggsy Bogues did it.' " This is a Virginia team that looks capable of playing with anyone. Its defense will allow it to play with anyone although that style of play also keeps games close. And, as the Cavaliers learned in March, the NCAA tournament is a crap shoot no matter how many games you win in the regular season. "I saw a quote," Bennett said, reciting it from heart: "'If you learn to use adversity right, it can take you to a place you couldn't have gone any other way.' "I think that's true. I watched my dad coach and my sister coach and I love being a coach. Losing that game hurt a lot, but I'm really okay. "We've all taken it head-on.

Virginia won the way it often wins - by shutting down the opposition just when it looked as if it might be in trouble. VCU freshman Vince Williams had hit a runner in the lane with 6:48 to play to put the Rams up, 43-38, and the crowd - less than the usual sellout because of the snow - was getting nervous. It didn't last long. The Cavaliers produced a five-point trip - Ty Jerome (14 points) made a three-pointer as a VCU foul was called away from the ball, and Kyle Guy (15 points) made both free throws to put the Cavaliers up 49-45 with 4:16 remaining. That, as it turned out, was the ballgame. The run swelled to 15-2, giving Virginia a 53-45 lead and the Cavaliers cruised from there. "Not sure that was the right call," Jerome admitted when the five-point sequence came up - the three-pointer appeared to have come after the whistle.;

Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing.;

no_fact; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; no_fact;

So did the fact that Dunham&rsquo;s open letter to Perrineau included multiple lengthy diversions about her own personal experiences in Hollywood.Some critics, such as CNN&rsquo;s Symone Sanders, questioned why Dunham had been given a high-profile, public forum to explain herself, while others suggested that the apology should have taken place in private. In fact, a November profile of Dunham in New York&rsquo;s The Cut reported that the actress and filmmaker had privately reached out to Perrineau to apologize this fall, after the Los Angeles District Attorney&rsquo;s Office declined to pursue charges against Miller. The conversation &ldquo;went better than expected,&rdquo; Perrineau&rsquo;s mother was quoted as saying.So why issue a long and drawn-out public apology, a year after the fact? Closing out her letter in the Hollywood Reporter, Dunham explained that she hoped her admission would lead to &ldquo;healing" and acknowledged that she wasn&rsquo;t likely to win over any new fans.&ldquo;There are some who will think I am writing this to curry public favor," she wrote, adding in a parenthetical: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, though, I stopped thinking that was an option for me somewhere around 2014, and that&rsquo;s some kind of freedom."; no_fact;

Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo. Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago. Nonetheless, in November 2018, scientists reported that nearly all extant populations of animals, including humans, may be a result of a population expansion that began between one and two hundred thousand years ago, based on genetic mitochondrial DNA studies. As such, humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a profound impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.;

"This is not a normal way that a cougar acts," Abbott said. "Most of the time, they're very afraid. ... Most of the time, they run off quickly." Before Saturday, just 16 cougar attacks, one of which was fatal, had been reported in Washington state during the past century. The first known fatal attack happened in the 1920s, when a boy named Jimmy Fehlhaber was devoured by a male cougar. Roughly 120 attacks, 25 of which were fatal, have been reported in the United States and Canada in the past 100 years. However, attacks involving cougars, also known as mountain lions, have been increasingly common in the past 20 years as humans encroach on wildlife habitats. In Washington state, for example, seven of all reported attacks occurred during the 1990s. [Two dogs in rural Virginia mauled their owner to death, authorities say. But why?]; there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.;
A mountain lion killed one mountain biker and mauled another in Washington state on May 19 when they rode into its territory. Authorities later shot the animal dead, police said. (Reuters) A cougar killed one person and seriously injured another in a rare attack Saturday in rural Washington state, authorities said. The victims were mountain biking near North Bend, a foothills town about 30 miles from Seattle, just after 11 a.m. when they realized that a cougar was chasing them. The bikers, at first, managed to drive the big cat away by making loud noises - something that authorities recommend people do during such encounters. One of the bikers also struck the animal's face, causing it to run toward the bushes, said Sgt. Ryan Abbott, spokesman for the King County Sheriff's Office. But just as they were about to ride away, the cougar came back and jumped on the head of one of the victims. "The first victim told us that the actual cougar's mouth was around his head. The cougar was trying to shake the victim from side to side," Abbott said. At that point, the other biker got off from his bike and ran away, which caught the cougar's attention. Abbott said the big cat then released the first victim and chased the other.;
no_fact; The victim took off on his bike and as soon as he looked back, he saw the cougar dragging his friend into the woods, Abbott said. Abbott said the victim rode about two miles to find cell reception, called 911 and screamed "Help!" into his phone. [People couldn't believe two dogs killed their owner. So the sheriff described the horror.] First responders from fire and sheriff's departments treated the victim, who suffered deep cuts throughout his body. About 2? miles away, they found the other victim's bike in the middle of a gravel trail. Further into the woods, they found the victim in the cougar's den, with the animal on top of him. Abbott said one of the deputies shot the cougar and missed, but the gunshot was enough to scare the animal away. Officers with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife used hounds to track the cougar, which was found behind a tree just 80 feet away, Abbott said. Abbott said the area is known for cougar sightings, but the attack was extremely rare.; no_fact; no_fact;

Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police has euthanized the cougar, a 100-pound male about 3 to 4 years old. The surviving victim is at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where his condition was upgraded to satisfactory on Saturday, according to media reports. Abbott said authorities have not identified the victims, only saying the one who survived is a 31-year-old man and the other was a 32-year-old man. According to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, 1- to 2-year-old cougars that have become independent of their mothers are more likely to attack domestic animals and humans. "When these young animals, particularly males, leave home to search for territory of their own, and encounter territory already occupied by an older male cougar, the older will drive off the younger one, killing it if it resists. Some young cougars are driven across miles of countryside in search of unoccupied territory," the agency said. If you encounter a cougar, don't run - because the animal's instinct is to chase. Instead, authorities advise people to never take their eyes off the animal and to try to appear larger and more intimidating. Shout, wave your arms and throw rocks, anything to let the animal know you are a threat and not prey. "If the cougar attacks, fight back aggressively and try to stay on your feet," according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. "Cougars have been driven away by people who fought back.";

no_fact; Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

The package the Celtics sent in exchange for Irving included Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder, who were then dealt away in midseason trades that netted the Cavs Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. Of course, those players haven't exactly been a great help to LeBron James, but then again, Irving ended up undergoing season-ending knee surgery in April, so he wouldn't have been much use to the Cavs if that had happened in Cleveland. Ultimately, this is all very hypothetical, as is the reasonable suggestion that even if Irving were on the Cavs, healthy and playing well, the Warriors might simply have taken the level of their own play up a notch. After all, that has been Golden State's M.O. for most of the season, seeming to only use as much of its overwhelming talent advantage as has been necessary. Irving would certainly have helped close that talent gap, but he's no longer with the Cavs, and James may not be long for the team himself, if the fervent churning of the rumor mill is any indication. Unsettlingly for Cleveland fans, that scenario could leave a Cleveland squad that might have some trouble taking a 3-0 lead in games next season, let alone in the NBA Finals.; no_fact; no_fact;

"It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.; "I think he really believes this stuff," he said. And just like a preacher who wants to share good news, McDaniel said, "Brady wants to let as many people as possible know about what he believes." Bob Ryan, a longtime-but-now-retired columnist for the Boston Globe, is more skeptical. He's fine with the on-field success. And promoting good nutrition and fitness is fine, as is having spiritual beliefs. But spare him the idea of Brady as a spiritual figure. "He's trying to sell us a bill of goods," Ryan said. "It's cultlike. The book, to me, is creepy. And it looks like that's going to be his life after football." As for Brady, he appears focused on the big game. And he shows no signs of quitting. "So if you're going to compete against me, you better be willing to give up your life," Brady says in the first episode of "Tom vs. Time." "Because I'm giving up mine.";

People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. "It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds," Wann said. "I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom." The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed: "In Bill We Trust," a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase "Do your job." Fans have bought in with near-religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. People invest a lot of hope in the team, Beneke said.;
Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.  Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.;

no_fact; no_fact; The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.;

no_fact; - That the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0; Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact;

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium. Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records  played at ​33 1⁄3 rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used alongside vinyl from the 1970s into the first decade of the 2000s.;

Even though Rudolph ultimately returns to save the day &mdash; using his glimmering snout to guide Santa through poor weather &mdash; there&rsquo;s no denying the verbal attacks Rudolph endures early on.&ldquo;Hey, fire snout!&rdquo; one young reindeer says, mocking him. Another teases with &ldquo;Rainbow puss!&rdquo;&ldquo;Stop calling me names!&rdquo; Rudolph cries in response.But was the red-nosed reindeer marginalized? That is the premise of a HuffPost video posted Wednesday to Twitter that has been viewed more than 5.3 million times as of Sunday afternoon.The video notes an instance in the film where Rudolph&rsquo;s father &ldquo;verbally abuses him.&rdquo; The father of Rudolph&rsquo;s love interest is called a &ldquo;bigot&rdquo; for forbidding his daughter from being seen with the red-nosed one.;

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

no_fact; 88D: [Fowls on Miami's basketball team?] is HEAT HENS, from heathens. This is my favorite of the bunch just because the clue worked out well. Some redefined animal phrases I left out: DANIEL'S TERN (based on the "Home Alone" actor Daniel Stern), PORT RAYS, FAUX HAWK, NOR EGRETS (possibly clued as [" ... and there can't be any marsh birds, either"? ]), and MALL ORCA (based on the island near Spain that's also spelled MAJORCA). I left out MEDAL LION, too, since I wasn't convinced there was a meaningful enough difference between a medallion and a medal to make the clue especially wacky. I was surprised that I couldn't find many good possibilities for APES at eight letters or more. There is SEXT APES, but .... yeesh, no thanks. Other answers and clues: 14A: [Civil rights movement demonstration] is SIT-IN, and right above is ERICA at 22A: [Late social justice activist Garner]. She passed away much too young just a few months ago. 53A: [Knee-length denim garment, perhaps] is JORTS, a portmanteau of "jeans" and "shorts." They're apparently making a comeback. We truly live in the Darkest Timeline. 97A: [Sole-stirring performance, say] is FOOT RUB. This isn't a theme answer, though the "sole" kind of makes it look like one.

"A few days ago, I just sat there with my wife and we just talked about how blessed we are to be in this moment.

no_fact; no_fact; PHILADELPHIA - Nick Foles went searching for clarity, for guidance and for direction, but in time, he found the answer resided within him all along. Nearly two years ago, the trajectory of his career led him to the same crossroads all NFL players eventually reach. And when it came time to choose his path, to decide whether to give up the game he loved or postpone retirement for at least one more season, Foles could think of only one thing to do. He prayed. Then he waited for an answer. "My heart said, 'Go back,' " he said of his decision to reunite with Coach Andy Reid in Kansas City in August 2016. At the time, Foles couldn't see the bigger picture, nor could he have predicted that he'd now be reflecting on that pivotal moment while standing in front of an NFC championship game backdrop at the Philadelphia Eagles' facility Wednesday afternoon. As he prepares for the biggest game of his six-year career, Sunday's NFC title game against the Minnesota Vikings, Foles couldn't help but point to that 2016 season with Reid as a career-defining moment - one that has helped him to this very day. "I'm a better person because of that decision," said Foles, whose turnover-free performance in last week's 15-10 divisional-round win over the Atlanta Falcons helped pave the way for the Eagles to reach the penultimate stage of these playoffs. "It wasn't an easy decision," added the veteran quarterback, a third-round draft pick of the Eagles in 2012 when Reid was their coach. "It wasn't like it was 100 percent, but my faith and my guidance and the way I felt going into that experience allowed me to grow to make me a better player now."; the circular huddle used in todays American Football was created by Paul D.

no_fact; no_fact; Ahead of their March for Our Lives event in D.C. on March 24, survivors of the Parkland, Fla. school massacre discussed their efforts to end mass shootings at a Harvard University panel on March 20. (The Washington Post) Thousands of students and their supporters are expected to descend upon Washington on Saturday to encourage lawmakers to act on gun control. But as young people become more of the focus in conversations about mass shootings, some say that their voices are being left out of the conversation - especially ones that don't fit in the current narrative. As many as half a million protesters are expected to fill the streets of Washington for the March for Our Lives, an anti-gun-violence rally organized by students. After a gunman killed 17 people at a South Florida high school in February, several survivors have gone to Capitol Hill, Harvard and cable news to get their message out for stricter gun control. But critics claim that the amount of attention these students have received has blocked out other important voices in the conversation. Kyle Kashuv, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., has met with the president and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. But he says he has not been given the platform and opportunities that his classmates with more liberal views on gun laws have, possibly because of his political views.;

Entering Sunday, they had recorded three consecutive shutouts and had not conceded multiple goals in a game in two months.But the Spartans got the only goal they needed and turned the defensive tables on the hosts to qualify for the quarterfinals for the fourth time in six seasons. Each of Georgetown&rsquo;s past five NCAA tournament appearances has ended with a home setback.The match was played at Cooper Field, the artificial-turf venue for football, lacrosse and field hockey, because of poor field conditions at Shaw Field following heavy rain and a women&rsquo;s game Saturday.The narrower dimensions hampered the Hoyas, who thrive on space, and were particularly detrimental in the second half, when the Spartans committed additional players to the defensive effort and permitted little room to operate.&ldquo;The field made it harder for the team that went down,&rdquo; Wiese said.;

Holiday messages are mostly about how it wouldn't be Christmas without presents and Santa Claus, but positive themes include family unity and believing in yourself. The movie also sends the idea that it can be okay to do something naughty (even illegal) if it's for a good cause. Santa is portrayed with a gruff exterior, but he cares about the kids and will do anything to save Christmas.

"The Holiday Calendar" is a romantic Christmas story with a mild magical element: an advent calendar that seems to be predicting the future. There's little content of concern for most ages, but the few kisses and adult situations make it best for tweens and up. A character uses "sucks" a few times, and main character Abby (Kat Graham) jokingly calls her friend "stupid" once or twice. Adults drink alcohol in social situations, but no excess is shown. The only violence is a joking offer to beat up an ex-boyfriend. Expect lots of positive representations of diverse races; Abby's close-knit, loving family offers a lot of great role models for African Americans especially.

Sugarland performs at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas a week after releasing its new album, "Bigger." (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Nettles and Bush, who co-wrote 10 out of 11 songs on the project, got to work soon after Bush stepped off the plane in New York. Still thinking about gun violence, Bush read some lines he had scribbled down, namely: How does he explain this topic to his kids? Nettles had recently read an article about civil rights activist Ruby Sales, who said the question that people need to ask each other is, "Where does it hurt?" As a result, the standout ballad "Tuesday's Broken" was born, and it addresses school shootings right off the bat: "Yesterday, hell rained down/Another kid, another school in another town/I think about how to tell my son/And I think about how that one got a gun." It segues into a person being driven to the edge by bullying: "What if we looked in her eyes and asked 'Where does it hurt? '/Would she find all she was worth?" Similarly striking songs touch on broader themes, such as "Mother," in which a parent accepts a child no matter who that child loves, and "Bird in a Cage," about people who feel trapped for a multitude of reasons. The duo hopes people listen to the full scope of the album; although songs like "Tuesday's Broken" might be considered "polarizing" because of the subject matter, they said, the majority of reactions on social media have been very positive.; no_fact;

no_fact; Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records  played at ​33 1⁄3 rpm.Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats.An album may be recorded in a recording studio (fixed or mobile), in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places.Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, so as to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", have reverberation, which creates a "live" sound.When long-playing records were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, and digital albums as they were introduced.;

Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto. Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalisation, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon.Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favour of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion.;

there are legless lizards that are basically lizards without limbs, but not snakes.; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).;

It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.; Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches;

These are actual dis tracks, with real production values, that you're spending time and energy on," Shelburne said on a recent ESPN podcast. "It just doesn't look all that professional. And it certainly doesn't look all that serious for a young team that's trying to position itself as a team that wants to win right now." "I know that the Lakers certainly want to let their guys have fun. They don't mind, on a certain level," Shelburne added. "But the latest stuff, I've definitely gotten some text messages back-and-forth in L.A., from people within and outside the organization doing a double take."

Kyle Kuzma, left and Lonzo Ball quickly grew close during their rookie season with the Lakers. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) As they say, it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, or in the case of Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma, loses a sense of where the boundaries are. So far, the pair of second-year Lakers have yukked it up for months while taking playful public shots at each other, but in the wake of a dis track recorded by Ball that got into a potentially sensitive area, their team has reportedly asked the pair of fast friends to take things down a notch. By recording the track, Ball brought their back-and-forth to a whole new level, one that has usually connoted nothing but bad blood in the hip-hop world, with the Drake-Pusha T feud a particularly glaring recent example. In Ball's song, titled "Kylie Kuzma," last year's second overall draft pick hurls insults at the No. 27 selection, but what got the most attention was his reference to the fact that Kuzma has said he never met his biological father. "Don't know who your daddy is," Ball rapped, "well your a- is getting sonned."; no_fact;
no_fact; According to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Ohm Youngmisuk, the Lakers, who "had grown concerned about the increasingly personal nature of some of the recent roasting between two of their young stars," decided it was time to sit them down for a little talk. Both players were said to have "agreed to tone down the joking insults on social media," with "no lingering issues." Presumably, that means we won't see Kuzma return fire in the form of his own dis track, at least not one released for public consumption. That would be a disappointment for, among others, Donovan Mitchell, the Jazz's rookie of the year candidate who had urged Kuzma to "respond." So @ZO2_ really made a diss track to his own teammate I'm really dead! @kylekuzma you gotta respond - Donovan Mitchell (@spidadmitchell) June 11, 2018 However, Kuzma had already gone a long way toward raising the stakes in a video he made last month with Bleacher Report.

no_fact; The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party), is one of the two major political parties in the United States, the other being its historic rival, the Democratic Party. The party is named after republicanism, a major ideology of the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex-National Republicans, ex-Free Soilers and Whigs in 1854, the Republicans largely dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern states between 1860 and 1932.Originally, the GOP subscribed to what is referred to as classical liberalism with ideological stands that were anti-slavery and pro-economic reform. The party was usually dominant over the Democrats during the Third Party System and Fourth Party System. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt formed the Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party after being rejected by the GOP and ran as a candidate. He called for many social reforms, some of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s. He lost the election, and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they were at odds with the new conservative economic stance, leading to them leaving for the Democratic Party and an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party. The liberal New Deal Democrats dominated the Fifth Party System at the national level. The liberal Republican element was overwhelmed by a conservative surge begun by Barry Goldwater in 1964 and fulfilled during the Reagan Era.Currently, their ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' liberal platform and progressive wing. The GOP's political platform supports lower taxes, free market capitalism, free enterprise, a strong national defense, gun rights, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the Republican Party is socially conservative and seeks to uphold traditional values based largely on Judeo-Christian ethics. The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs from its founding until the 1930s when it was based in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. Since 1952, there has been a reversal against protectionism and for free trade. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. After the 1960s, whites increasingly identified with the Republican Party. After the Roe v. Wade 1973 Supreme Court ruling, the Republican Party made opposition to abortion a key plank of its national party platform and grew its support among Evangelicals. By 2000, the Republican party was firmly aligned with Christian conservatism. The party's core support since the 1990s comes chiefly from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North. Catholics were long the backbone of the Democratic Party, but since the 1970s have split about evenly, as well as racially, with white Catholics moving to the Republicans. Mormons are heavily Republican.Along with the GOP winning 24 of the last 40 presidential elections there have been a total of 19 Republican Presidents, the most from any one party. The first was 16th President Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 until his assassination in 1865; the most recent being the 45th and current president Donald Trump, who took the oath of office on January 20, 2017. However, the Republicans have lost the popular vote in six out of the last seven Presidential elections, as its traditional demographic is reducing as a proportion of the US population.As of  2018, the Republican Party is the primary party in power in the United States, holding the presidency (Donald Trump), majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, a majority of governorships and state legislatures (full control of 32/50, split control of five others); in the 2018 midterm elections, the GOP was voted out of the House, though it kept its Senate majority, with the new Congress to be inaugurated in 2019. Furthermore, the GOP presently hold "trifectas" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a "trifecta plus" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. They accomplished this partially through gerrymandering and controversial lame-duck legislation.;

no_fact; no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

Former Mets manager Terry Collins gives umpire Tom Hallion an earful in a 2016 game. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Over the past couple of days, a video has gone viral, and for very good reason: it provides remarkable, uncensored audio of a baseball manager chewing out umpires after his pitcher was ejected from a game. If you haven't seen it - and heard it - you might want to hurry up, because MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday his staff is doing what it can to scrub the footage from the Internet. "We made a commitment to the umpires that if they would wear microphones, certain types of interactions that we all know go on on the field would not be aired publicly," Manfred said, following owners meetings in New York. However, as many have pointed out, the umpire who most bears the brunt of former Mets manager Terry Collins's rage in the video, which is from 2016, comports himself admirably. Crew chief Tom Hallion does drop an f-bomb or two in his own right, but only in service of trying to defuse the profanity-spewing Collins while showing empathy for the manager. The background for the explosive moment was an incident in the 2015 playoffs, when the Dodgers' Chase Utley broke the leg of the Mets' Ruben Tejada on a slide into second base that many observers, and not just in the New York dugout, thought was dirty. Utley was initially suspended two games, but he appealed and was able to stay active for the rest of the series, won in five games by a Mets team that chose to save retribution for a less meaningful time.;

Sure, dude. Hallion twice says, "Our a- is in the jackpot," which has generally been interpreted as making the point that his crew had to take action after the pitch at Utley because the teams' recent history meant the series was already under scrutiny from MLB officials. Former Met Neil Walker asks a fair question about why there hadn't been a warning beforehand, to which Hallion replies, "Everybody knows what the situation is." Collins goes old-school in asking for frontier justice, yelling, "You gotta give us a shot!" Hallion shows great understanding of Collins's frustration, taking little apparent umbrage at the manager's language and asking as Collins finally starts cooling down, "You got everything out?" Manfred explained Thursday, though, that his office not only "promised" its umpires that if they agreed to wear microphones, the audio would never leak out, but that such a stipulation was written into their collective bargaining agreement. "We had no choice in a situation like that, then, to do everything possible to live up to our agreement," the commissioner said (via the AP).;

no_fact; [How Kyrie Irving's injury impacts the Celtics this season and beyond] For most of the game, the Wizards didn't bother playing defense. Atlanta had six players score in double figures - including reserves Tyler Dorsey (22) and Damion Lee (11) - and shot 48.1 percent from the field. The Wizards yawned at the prospect of running an offense - the cacophony of clanked jumpers filled the void inside an otherwise silent Capital One Arena. Bradley Beal dominated the offense, likely out of necessity. John Wall did not play on the second night of a back-to-back set. That - and Morris's ejection - left the Wizards without two starters. Beal reacted by taking 24 shots, nearly three times as many as Otto Porter Jr., the starter with the next highest total. Beal finished with 32 points on 50 percent shooting, but as a unit, Washington shunned "Everybody Eats" for a less-effective method: "Nobody Passes." Center Marcin Gortat led the team with four assists, and Brooks was asked afterward why a team that had been praised for sharing the ball had stopped doing it. "Yeah, maybe they're listening to all the praise," Brooks said. "Can't listen to the praise. You just got to do what you do, and that's passing the ball. We haven't passed in the past couple of weeks." Beal left the locker room before reporters were allowed to enter. Morris did not stick around, either, continuing his trend for the night.;
Scott Brooks had seen enough. Late in the fourth quarter of the Washington Wizards' loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Mike Muscala hit an open three-pointer to give the worst team in the Eastern Conference a lead it would not relinquish. Brooks responded by calling a timeout, and he walked onto the court covering his face with the palms of his hands. The Hawks' 103-97 win Friday night was tough to take in for the Wizards coach. It was his team's fourth straight defeat with the playoffs looming, and he did not hold back in his diagnosis of the Wizards' ills. "Selfish basketball is no fun to coach, it's no fun to play with, and it's no fun to watch," Brooks said, "and we're a selfish basketball team right now." After the Wizards' bad losses - and there have been plenty - Brooks has fumed while sharing his postgame thoughts. In the past, he has threatened to tear apart the rotation, called out specific players and ranted about millionaires who refuse to show effort. In Friday's postgame news conference, Brooks hit the trifecta. [John Wall is playing like an all-star, but the chemistry is missing] On the defense that allowed Atlanta to make 11 three-pointers, including the backbreaker from Muscala: "We got to start guarding somebody, and we got to start moving the basketball the way we're capable of doing it. If we're not going to do that, I'll find five guys to do that. I don't care how small we are or how big we are." On Markieff Morris picking up a pair of technical fouls in the first quarter: "You can't get frustrated enough to get thrown out of a game, especially when we're shorthanded. . .;

When official Leroy Richardson issued the two quick technicals, he gestured off the court to signal the ejection. Morris slowly moved to the scorer's table, then eventually to the locker room. His teammates remained on the court and played basketball at the same slothful pace. "It's not a divided team. It's a together team, but if we're going to talk about doing things, we've got to do it with our actions," Brooks said. "We got to guard somebody. Our perimeter defense is porous.

. He knows that. He's been in this league long enough, and we cannot continue to put ourselves in those positions." And on the Wizards (42-38) dragging through 48 minutes against a team bent on losing to secure a top lottery pick: "To me, it's not an embarrassing loss to lose to Atlanta with their guys out. It's embarrassing that we don't play with the passion that we need to play at." This time next week, the Wizards will be preparing for Game 1 of their playoff series. Whether they will start in Toronto (as the current seeding would dictate because the Wizards dropped to eighth place), Boston, Cleveland or Philadelphia has yet to be determined. And at this point, the opponent shouldn't matter. The fact that it will be a playoff team should provide the Wizards some consolation - on Thursday night, Washington and the Cleveland Cavaliers played an entertaining game that oozed with postseason energy. But conference doormats such as the Hawks (23-57)? They bore the Wizards into a stupor. "You have to respect everyone who plays in the NBA," point guard Tomas Satoransky said. "Everyone in the NBA is good, and you have to respect that, and I feel like we didn't do this today. It's bad from all of us. You just have to blame all of us because it's a team sport and we really have to do better.";

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding.

This was magic. This was baseball.In my cynical moments, I wonder why I ever invested so much of my heart in this ridiculous team. Growing up a Mets fan &mdash; especially in New York in the &lsquo;90s &mdash; was an exercise in disappointment. Which I suppose was good preparation for what came next: The Wilpons&rsquo; financial mismanagement, MLB&rsquo;s poor handling of racism, sexism and domestic violence. At the end of the day, I remind myself, baseball players are just athletic men being highly compensated to chase a tiny white ball around a diamond-shaped patch of grass.

no_fact; no_fact; William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.;

Brittany DilibertoMacbeth (Ian Merrill Peakes), center, explains his deeds to Macduff (Chris Genebach) in the Restoration-era version of &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; now at the Folger Theatre. The big changes to the &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; at the Folger Theatre include famous monologues that have been substantially trimmed; a newly heroic Macduff and Lady Macduff, who have bigger roles than Shakespeare dreamed of; and witches in extended sequences of song and dance.Why? Not because director Robert Richmond had some hot new concept he wanted to try. Instead, this &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; is a painstakingly assembled revival of a version that&rsquo;s about 350 years old, adapted by William Davenant as London&rsquo;s theaters reopened after being shut down for 18 years during England&rsquo;s Civil War.In the 1660s, Davenant jazzed up &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; with trends he&rsquo;d seen in France &mdash; music, ballet and moving painted scenery among them, plus women onstage (not just men). That suited England&rsquo;s new Francophile king and entertained a fresh wave of audiences getting reacquainted with the stage.&ldquo;People have been messing around with Shakespeare since the first generation after Shakespeare,&rdquo; says Richard Schoch, a scholar at Queen&rsquo;s University at Belfast, in Northern Ireland, who helped spearhead this rare &ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just us.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is surprising that more of this hasn&rsquo;t been done,&rdquo; agrees Syracuse professor Amanda Winkler, who is the &ldquo;co-investigator&rdquo; with Schoch on Performing Restoration Shakespeare, a three-year effort funded by Britain&rsquo;s Arts and Humanities Research Council. &ldquo;We think it will appeal to modern audiences because of its variety, the music &mdash; the way everything works together.&rdquo;The goal for Schoch and Winkler is to get some of the Restoration-era Shakespearean adaptations into full productions, both to see what they were like and to give modern audiences a different angle on material we already know awfully well.;

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) A pair of NBA all-stars with D.C. ties will be featured prominently in ESPN The Magazine's upcoming State of the Black Athlete issue. Wizards point guard John Wall, who was selected by Washington with the No. 1 pick of the 2010 NBA draft, and Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant, who was honored with a championship parade in his home town of Seat Pleasant last August, both wrote letters that will appear in the issue and were published this week on The Undefeated. Wall's honest and heart-rending letter, which you should really take the time to read in full, is addressed to his late father, John Carroll Wall, who spent much of Wall's childhood in prison and died of liver cancer days before Wall's ninth birthday. "We'd make the two-hour drive every weekend to see you, sometimes rolling two cars deep," Wall writes. "Some of the things I got used to in my early years were getting patted down and thoroughly checked by prison guards and walking down long prison corridors with the sounds of those prison gates opening and closing." Wall recalls one day playing in the water and going on rides with his father, who had just been released, at a North Carolina resort in the summer of 1999 as the best of his young life. He didn't know at the time that his father had only been permitted to leave prison a month early because of his illness. Wall remembers the "horrific smell" of his father's hemorrhage that day and his father being rushed to the hospital.;

no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.;

She not only co-wrote more than 10 textbooks, but also created a whole new field of heritage- language studies focused on immigrants with only an imperfect grasp of their native tongue. Mom developed an interest in heritage-language education after noticing an increasing number of students in her UCLA classes whose parents were Russian. These students were annoying their classmates because they spoke the language so effortlessly. Many instructors saw heritage speakers as disruptive nuisances who were just after easy grades, but Mom said, "If they come for an easy grade and that's what we give them, it's our fault, not theirs." She designed a class for heritage speakers at UCLA that advanced them to high-level coursework in one year by building on what they know rather than harping on their deficiencies. She went on to create the National Heritage Language Resource Center with a grant from the U.S. Education Department, because she thought it made sense, in a globalizing world, for more Americans to become bilingual. I like to think I inspired her professional success with the C that I earned in the only Russian-language class that I took in college. At Mom's funeral, mourner after mourner spoke about what a wonderful teacher she was. She was certainly devoted to her students. Even after she found out months ago that chemotherapy had failed, she was still making plans to return to her beloved classroom in the spring.;

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week.

The effort to reduce smoking in the United States began in 1964, when the government acknowledged for the first time that smoking is harmful to health. By 2015, the United States had managed to cut the smoking rate by more than half. When the campaign began, doctors were still telling pregnant women that it was safe for them to smoke. Fifty years later, smoking has been banned in many public spaces. What made this campaign so successful? First, the government used its regulatory powers. Much like Big Tobacco in the 1950s, the tech industry today operates in an unregulated environment. Facebook, Twitter and Google are all keen to avoid being treated as media companies, which would make them subject to a slew of Federal Communications Commission regulations. So far, when left to their own devices, the companies have made only superficial changes to their platforms at the behest of new European regulation around user data privacy. These voluntary efforts are failing to curtail the spread of disinformation, and sooner or later the tech industry will have to face the same FCC restrictions on content and advertising as traditional media - which would undoubtedly help to reduce the spread of erroneous reporting.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy.

Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).;

The company touted Whitaker's credentials as a former U.S. attorney and Republican Senate candidate. Whitaker publicly vouched for the firm in promotional materials. In exchange, he received $9,375 between 2014 and early 2016; the company's chief executive also donated $2,600 to Whitaker's Senate campaign, and the company owed him an additional $7,500 at the time the FTC moved to seize it. Whitaker is not personally named in the FTC complaint, and we don't know the extent of his day-to-day involvement with the company. But he does not appear to have been a totally passive observer. Among its court exhibits, the FTC included a 2015 email Whitaker sent while acting on behalf of the company.; Many assume Matthew G. Whitaker was chosen as acting attorney general because he criticized the Russia probe, said he would have indicted Hillary Clinton and otherwise looks like a die-hard Trump loyalist. But maybe Whitaker really was picked because he has experience advising con artists. Whitaker, after all, was involved with a Miami-based firm that federal regulators shut down last year as an alleged scam. The firm, World Patent Marketing, promised aspiring inventors that it would patent and market their brainchildren, based on what a 17-page Federal Trade Commission complaint characterized as bogus "success stories" and other false claims. Among the many, many ways this company hoodwinked customers, according to the FTC complaint: It claimed its customers' inventions were sold in "big box" stores such as Walmart and Target, when in fact none were; it claimed it owned a manufacturing plant in China, though no such plant existed; and it said its board of advisers ("Invention Team Advisory Board") personally reviewed customers' invention ideas, when the board did no such thing. The company allegedly bilked some customers out of their life savings and threw others deeply into debt; a Miami New Times expos? found that some had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In return, the company "provided almost no service," according to the FTC. Just as bad, when customers complained or asked for refunds, the FTC said, the company resorted to threats and intimidation. Sometimes this involved ominous references to World Patent Marketing's "intimidating security team, all ex-Israeli Special Ops and trained in Krav Maga, one of the most deadly of the martial arts."; no_fact;

Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having 9 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup (4.25 inches in diameter). There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or "sand traps"), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.; no_fact;

It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.;

The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black; In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

no_fact; The effect is that each profile is akin to a lovingly stitched story quilt, the bright panels unfolding with exquisite precision and inviting visual pacing.

Penelope Bagieu's "Brazen" includes the story of the martyred "Las Mariposas" sisters in the Dominican Republic. (First Second Books/Macmillan 2018) These comic bios also require Bagieu to be a nimble architect of quick story arcs, whether charting how Margaret Hamilton cut her own path into Hollywood, straight to the Yellow Brick Road (as the cackling Wicked Witch), or how a heroic airborne icon, Mae Jemison, became the first black woman in space. Brevity requires exacting blueprints. Then there's the challenge that these 29 short-form arcs could turn formulaic by repetition if not for some especially elevating traits. One apt aspect is that every heroine's story is alike in that it begins in girlhood; yet each is so different in how it foreshadows themes specific to that rebel lady's life.; no_fact;

The lawsuit reaffirms that Alex's holy sojourn was fantasy. "The portrayal of Alex's near-death experience contained in the book is entirely false, because Alex remembers absolutely nothing from the time he was in a coma. The core of the story is entirely false." But the complaint also alleges Tyndale House has not cooperated with Alex as he tries to solve the complicated legacy behind the book. Only Kevin Malarkey signed a publishing agreement for the book. This January, Alex's attorneys wrote to Tyndale House asking for an "accounting of all revenue earned from, all expenses associated with, and all disbursements made in association with the publication of and sale of the book." The publisher, however, only agreed to do so if Alex agreed the publishing agreement was "in effect and binding," the lawsuit says. "Alex has never been permitted to read the contract, nor to review any accountings provided under the contract, he refuses to acknowledge that the contract 'is in effect and binding,' now that he has reached the age of majority," the suit states. Alex is suing the publisher on the grounds of defamation, financial exploitation, and publicity placing a person in a false light, among others. "Despite the fact that Tyndale House has made millions of dollars off Alex's identity and an alleged autobiographical story of his life, Tyndale House paid Alex, a paralyzed young man, nothing," the lawsuit states. Correction: An earlier version of this story said that Kevin Malarkey was deceased. He is not.

"I did not go to Heaven. I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention." The admission created a firestorm within the worlds of evangelical faith and Christian publishing. The controversy was revived this week when Alex - now 20 years old and living off Social Security - filed a lawsuit against Tyndale House in Illinois's DuPage County, where the publisher is located. The complaint alleges Kevin Malarkey was the main actor behind the fabrication. "Kevin Malarkey ... concocted a story that, during the time Alex was in a coma, he had gone to Heaven, communicated with God the Father, Jesus, angels, and the devil, and then returned," the complaint says. "Kevin Malarkey sold the concocted story, allegedly about Alex's life and what Alex allegedly experienced, to one of the largest Christian publishers in the country." Alex has also not received any of the revenue related to his story, the lawsuit alleges. When reached for comment, a Tyndale House representative told The Washington Post the publisher had just learned of the lawsuit on Tuesday and planned to release a response on Wednesday. After the publication of "The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven," behind the scenes of the tremendous success, Alex's distaste for the project was building. According to a 2015 report by the Guardian, Alex's mother Beth had begun posting on a personal blog (now taken down) about inaccuracies in the book since at least 2011.

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.;

Arizona's Brandon Randolph (5) and Dusan Ristic (14) after their surprising NCAA tournament loss. (Ted S. Warren/AP) It's as much a fixture of March Madness as shocking upsets and squeaky sneaker noises. But this year there are increasing calls for TV cameras to lay off those images of children weeping inconsolably when their basketball team loses. Often, those tearful images become memes or are used in tweets that are shared a seemingly infinite number of times. Is it time for broadcasters to stop showing the distraught young kids? "It's part of the drama and the storytelling of the tournament," CBS executive producer Harold Bryant told Yahoo, speaking for that network and Turner, the networks that carry the NCAA tournament. "It's part of the emotion. We try to capture the emotion and we try to strike that right balance." Still, these are kids and they often are, to put it mildly, mocked for their emotional breakdowns. Maybe, unlike adults, they haven't yet had the life-crushing experience of seeing their favorite teams lose a last-minute heartbreaker. Do you remember the first time the team you root for lost in crushing fashion? Tom Brady's kids were roped into a similar conversation after the New England Patriots' Super Bowl loss to Philadelphia, when Gisele B?ndchen explained to two of their crying kids that Daddy couldn't win all the time. Bryant, the producer, stresses that this is all part of the story. The "right balance" was his go-to description, according to Yahoo's Henry Bushnell, when asked whether zeroing in on kids was a too-convenient way to amp up the drama. "We show happy kids, we show sad kids, we show happy adults, we show players that are happy, we show players that are sad, crying on the benches or on the floor," Bryant told Yahoo.;

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

"We can't control what people are doing on the Internet," Bryant told Bushnell. "We've gotta strike a balance. We've gotta be journalistic and cover the story.";

no_fact; no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.; Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.;

None of the players or coaches interviewed for this story had heard of a team that had to forfeit a game, but officials from the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association and the VHSL confirmed it has happened at least once in each state. Another issue is dealing with situations like the one the Panthers faced against St. Anne's-Belfield: Hard pitch counts don't account for the context of a game. In last year's Maryland 4A state semifinals, Severna Park had the same problem as Potomac School: Its starter reached 105 pitches with one out remaining and the Falcons leading by two. A reliever came in, and Howard tagged him for three runs to earn a spot in the state title game. As the playoffs begin, the rest aspect of the rules may become more important than the pitch count maximum. While starting pitchers reaching triple digits is fairly rare, many teams often use their best arms in relief situations. Leonardtown Coach Chris Schoenbauer said the rules haven't had an ill effect on the high school game, but they have changed the way it must be managed. "It's different than the old rules, but it's important. There's just no need for a 16-year-old to be throwing more than 105 pitches in a baseball game," he said. "You have to think long term."

no_fact; Josh Allen of Wyoming (17) is among the top QBs available in this NFL draft. (Brynn Anderson/Associated Press) The New York Jets ensured themselves of getting one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL draft. But it cost them plenty. After a free agent flurry in which they added Teddy Bridgewater and re-signed Josh McCown but missed out on Kirk Cousins, the Jets made a major trade Saturday to move up three spots in the NFL draft order by landing the No. 3 overall pick from the Indianapolis Colts. The deal costs the Jets, in addition to the No. 6 overall choice, a trio of second-round selections, including two this year and one next year. The Jets, at worst, will get their third choice from among a highly regarded group of quarterbacks in this draft that includes Southern California's Sam Darnold, UCLA's Josh Rosen, Wyoming's Josh Allen and Oklahoma's polarizing Heisman Trophy winner, Baker Mayfield. It's possible, although seemingly unlikely, that they could have been shut out if they'd stayed put at No. 6. [If you blinked, you might have missed the NFL's rapid QB reshuffling in free agency] There are plenty of implications from the trade for the Jets, for the Colts, for the draft itself and for the other teams lining up to select quarterbacks on draft night, particularly the Buffalo Bills. The Jets followed the first rule of NFL roster construction: If you don't have a franchise quarterback, you do whatever it takes to try to get one.; no_fact;

But they could take running back Saquon Barkley at No. 1 and still know that they would get one of the top quarterbacks at No. 4. The New York Giants pick second and might add a successor-in-waiting to Eli Manning. The Denver Broncos, with the No. 5 choice, just signed Keenum as a free agent but might not be done re-fortifying the position. All of that could be problematic for the Bills, who traded Taylor to the Browns and signed AJ McCarron in free agency. The Taylor trade left the Bills with five of the first 65 picks in this draft. They have the draft's 12th and 22nd overall selections. They have plenty to give if they want to trade up for the Giants' pick or one of the Browns' top-four choices. And it would take plenty, judging by what the Jets just surrendered to move up only three spots.; Eli Manning's Full First Name is Elisha.;
Eli Manning's Full First Name is Elisha.; They weren't in the market for a quarterback on draft night, as they continue to keep their fingers crossed about Andrew Luck making a successful return after he missed all of last season following shoulder surgery. The Colts will get a promising player at another position at No. 6. They emerge with three second-rounders to add three more potential starters. General Manager Chris Ballard continues to show a steady hand after recovering quickly from the Josh McDaniels fiasco during the team's head coaching search to hire Frank Reich. The top of the draft becomes even more intriguing and even more quarterback-centric now. The teams in possession of the draft's top five picks now are potential quarterback-takers, although that involves only four quarterbacks since the Cleveland Browns have the first and fourth selections. What will the Browns do at No. 1? They traded for Tyrod Taylor, and Coach Hue Jackson already has named Taylor the team's Week 1 starter. The Taylor trade clearly should not keep the Browns from drafting a would-be franchise quarterback.; no_fact;

The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.; no_fact;

In those moments, "Playing Changes" begins to earn its spot on the highest shelf, between A.B. Spellman's legendary "Four Lives in the Bebop Business" and Ben Ratliff's enlightening "The Jazz Ear" - books where the authors and the artists take turns striking at the heart of the artform. Perhaps the most grounding idea in "Playing Changes" comes directly from saxophonist Steve Coleman, a Chicago native who stands as one of the most cerebral composers around. In describing his process, Coleman makes his extraordinary jazz problems sound a lot like everyday life problems: "The only thing that means anything, to me, is: What do I know this year that's different than what I knew two years ago? And am I doing something about it?" To get a sense of what that struggle might sound like when it's blasting out of Coleman's horn, flip ahead to the end of the book, where Chinen lists "The 129 Essential Albums of the Twenty-First Century (So Far)," including Coleman's 2010 "Harvesting Semblances and Affinities." Each album Chinen has chosen is worth at least one spin on your handy pocket computer - but instead of listening in order, year by year, why not honor the nonlinear spirit of this book and jump around? "Playing Changes" encourages us to listen to jazz the same way we might try to live life: Start anywhere, go everywhere. Chris Richards is the pop music critic at The Washington Post.

Institutional elevation. Street-level energy. Renewal. Definition. Freedom." That's a big list, but Chinen believes that there are scores of jazz players floating around who are well-suited to scratch each of those itches, and he'd like to introduce us to them. So while he dedicates entire chapters to certain contemporary jazz heroes - Jason Moran, Esperanza Spalding and Brad Mehldau among them - nobody gets the hero treatment. Remember what Chinen said about linear narratives and networks of possibility? Narratives have heroes. Networks not so much. Author Nate Chinen. (Michael Lionstar) Sharp listening and clear thinking are the epoxy holding this ambitious overview together, but the pages really start to glow whenever Chinen invites the musicians to speak for themselves.;

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones.Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.;

Please do everything in your power to lay the groundwork for a Redskins dynasty that will bring joy to the fans and the city for years to come. In my opinion, the first step to achieving that dream is this: Please give Kirk Cousins a long-term deal that makes him happy to be Redskin, even if that means making him the highest-paid player in NFL history. Thank you." [Kirk Cousins in Washington: A timeline from awkward start to lucrative departure] Of course, the Redskins didn't give Cousins a long-term deal, instead trading for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and allowing Cousins to depart via free agency. And this is how Snyder responds five months later to what must have been one of the most fawning letters he has ever received from a fan? "As the great Ron Burgundy once said, 'I'm not even mad. I'm impressed,' " Fraedrich said. "Impressed at the complete disregard. I'm convinced it would have been better if he had just never responded. Not that I'm genuinely offended by it given the hilarity of the whole situation, but it seems to be objectively kind of a jacka- move."

- and most importantly, how to prohibit that critical voice inside my head from defining who I am on an everyday basis." Smith, 39, urged anyone considering the core question he grappled with - what's wrong with me? - to ask for help. In that, he echoed other athletes who have come forward in recent years with their own stories about depression. Chargers tackle Joe Barksdale explained to the Los Angeles Times, "Some days you can talk yourself out of it. Some days you can't. Some days it just feels impossible." Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has said that, at times, he "straight up wanted to die." The NBA's Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan shared their stories, too, while wide receiver Brandon Marshall - one of the first athletes to openly advocate for mental health awareness - has called that "the civil rights issue of our era.";

Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling stock to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements that appear onscreen.; no_fact; no_fact;

In computer science  AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Tesler's Theorem, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.;

no_fact; It can&rsquo;t be, because you want to pass it around, you want to get into your pick-and-roll plays.&rdquo;&ldquo;But hey, we&rsquo;re the Lakers,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;People are going to be talking about us. But that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s going right now.&rdquo;During James&rsquo;s second stint in Cleveland, when he led the team to the NBA Finals in four straight seasons while helping win its first NBA title, he was surrounded with shooters who could spot up at the three-point line and wait for him to break down a defense and find them with the ball. After he committed this summer to the Lakers, though, they took a different approach, bringing in veterans such as Rondo and Lance Stephenson to augment a young core featuring Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Jason Hart.While that group offered versatility and an expectation of playing better defense than the notoriously porous Cavs, it notably appeared to lack outside shooting; in other words, Johnson seemed to be deliberately moving away from what had worked so well for James for so many years. However, as he emphasized in his radio appearance, the intended trade-off was to reduce James&rsquo;s workload and keep him relatively fresh in his age-34 season, particularly after a final Cleveland campaign in which the four-time NBA MVP played all 82 games for the first time in his career and led the NBA in average minutes for the second straight year.&ldquo;We are trying to make sure that we watch his minutes, but also that we don&rsquo;t run everything through him because now it is Cleveland all over again, and we don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; Johnson said (via ESPN). &ldquo;We want to get up and down.&rdquo;Johnson added that his team was &ldquo;trying to make sure we don&rsquo;t overplay&rdquo; James, saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of ballhandlers, so we feel we won&rsquo;t overuse him in terms of his ballhandling and also every play has to run through him.; no_fact;

They found the ring, still in its dish. Even though the ring was charred and missing the diamond, Ishu decided to recreate one of the couple's happiest moments. Surrounded by the fire's devastation, he knelt down on one knee and proposed to Laura again. The impromptu proposal was caught on camera by Mike Eliason, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. Eliason then shared the image in a tweet. #HolidayFire- Having lost their Fairview Ave home of 3 years Friday night, Ishu and Laura Rao returned w Santa Barbara Co Fire to let Laura search for her wedding ring. She found the damaged Tiffany ring & Ishu promptly dropped to a knee and asked her to marry him again. - SBCFireInfo (@EliasonMike) July 8, 2018 "I just thought it was kind of cute and I thought it might put a smile on her face," Ishu said. "I think I just said, 'Will you marry me again?' There wasn't anything drawn out about it." The gesture took Laura by surprise. "It was so sweet," she said. "It just made things feel lighter because it was so heavy around us.;
no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; There were homes that were down to the studs and neighbors and firemen everywhere. It just made a bad situation better for that moment." Of course, she said yes - again. "It was truly a special moment out of the ashes," Eliason told the Associated Press. But what became of the diamond? Ishu said he looked it up. "I think I read online that diamonds will vaporize at 800 degrees" Celsius. Wildfires can reach that temperature and beyond. National Geographic agrees that indeed, at that unfortunate point, "Diamonds Aren't Forever." After leaving the site, the Raos went straight to Tiffany and Co., Ishu said. He added that the store is already helping the couple find a replacement ring. Ishu said he never expected that the proposal would get so much attention. "I'm glad it's made other people happy, but it made her happy, so for me, that's the only thing that really mattered," he said.

A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects and a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and a Ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs. Some hats have religious functions, such as the mitres worn by Bishops and the turban worn by Sikhs.; until 1998, British politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons;

A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

Trousers (British English) or pants (American English) are an item of clothing that might have originated in East Asia, worn from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in robes, skirts, and dresses).In the United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers. Shorts are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending on the style of the garment. To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called "long trousers" in certain contexts such as school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called "short trousers", especially in the UK.; no_fact; no_fact;

A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.; no_fact;

Netflix and YouTube together make up half of peak Internet traffic in North America; Kanye West told "TMZ Live" May 1 that slavery sounds "like a choice." This isn't the first time West's comments have caused a stir. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post) Kanye West made headlines across the nation recently when he asked a seemingly reasonable question: "Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery?" A self-made man, West echoed another self-made man from a century earlier. Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee Institute, famously did not wish to dwell on the past, either. But those who don't wish to dwell on the past ought not to spout history. And that is where West made his big mistake. To defend his assertion that black people made a choice not to flee slavery, West attributed to Harriet Tubman the statement: "I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves." Research about the Underground Railroad's most famous conductor is best not done on YouTube. In writing a new book, I have spent the past year retracing Tubman's steps from her birthplace in Maryland to her grave in New York. The journey has been a humbling one, particularly because the person who traveled it first was so humble. Not that she wasn't sometimes boastful.;

romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature.; Its public education director, Bob Schaeffer, said my grandson's comments show him to be in tune with reality. "Time devoted to testing and test prep is time taken away from teaching and learning," Schaeffer said. "Rather than fostering higher educational achievement . . . the current environment bores many kids and undermines any love of school." Schaeffer argued that the lack of an aggressive opt-out movement in California - where my grandson lives - and in other states is the result of battles already won by the protesters. California law says parents are free to exempt their children from tests with no penalty. Virginia and Maryland have reduced testing in recent years. Federal sanctions for states falling below a 95 percent test participation rate have never been applied.; no_fact;
no_fact; Should parents exempt their children from state-required standardized tests? This is personal for me, as my grandson, a 9-year-old third-grader, just became the first in the family to sit for one of those long, controversial exams. The opt-out movement is led by parents and teachers who think the tests are poorly designed, needlessly stressful and pervasively misused. It made big news in 2015 when 20 percent of New York state schoolchildren refused to be tested. The number of families taking that stand in New York hasn't increased significantly since, although it remains impressive. In most other states, the issue has little traction. That doesn't mean the protesters are wrong. After making my grandsons what I considered a sublime meal of grilled cheese sandwiches and carrots - followed by a choice of ice cream - the oldest agreed to tell me what happened with the testing. He didn't appear to be too stressed, even though his tests lasted two hours every day for seven days. He said he liked the test-prep leading up to the exams because he no longer had to master new material.;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; the world record for speed reading is held by  Anne Jones, with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute;

Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said that the team got better at quarterback with the trade for Alex Smith. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) The Washington Redskins basically swapped Kirk Cousins for Alex Smith by sending Kendall Fuller and a third-round pick to Kansas City and letting Cousins walk in free agency. At 33 years old, Smith is four years older than Cousins, and some have called him an older, slightly cheaper version of the Vikings' new starting quarterback. Washington doesn't see it that way, and Coach Jay Gruden said it plainly during an interview session with multiple reporters at the owners annual meeting. "Yeah, without a doubt," Gruden said when asked if Washington is better off. "I don't want to compare two players, but we're always trying to be better at every position. We got better. Alex's experience is well-noted, and his record the last five years is what it is. You could argue that all day, but we feel very good." It is difficult to say which quarterback is superior with any reasonable level of certainty, but we can compare numbers and situations. Smith has thrown for 11,030 yards with 61 touchdowns and 20 interceptions in the last three seasons. The 2017 campaign was a career year with 4,042 yards and just five interceptions. He never completed less than 65.3 percent of his passes in those three seasons.;

The Redskins, arguably, may have had more offensive weaponry during that time period, but 2017 is an exception. Last season was a mess for Washington's supporting cast due to injuries on the offensive line, at running back (including breakout receiving back Chris Thompson) and to tight end Jordan Reed. The most available playmakers on a weekly basis were receivers Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson, Ryan Grant and tight end Vernon Davis. Washington, though, still had receivers Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson in 2015 and 2016. [Redskins need a running back - and this NFL draft offers plenty of options] Smith had his best offensive surrounding case in 2017 with dynamic rookie running back Kareem Hunt, tight end Travis Kelce and speedy receiver Tyreek Hill. All three were Pro Bowlers last season. The Chiefs were without an injured Jamaal Charles for much of the previous two seasons and relied on Kelce. Receiver Jeremy Maclin was on the roster in 2016 and 2015 while Spencer Ware and Charcandrick West filled in for Charles. There are many factors and variables that go into a quarterback's play that comparisons can be difficult, but there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in production over the last three seasons. NOTES: The Redskins waived running back LeShun Daniels on Thursday afternoon. The 2017 undrafted rookie played in four games and had three rushes for 14 yards. He was signed to the practice squad in mid-November and activated to the full roster a week later. Daniels became the fifth Redskins running back to go on injured reserve last season after breaking his hand in practice.;

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Amazon.com has released a list of 20 regions in the United States and Canada that the online retail giant is considering as possible sites for its second headquarters. The list, released Thursday, includes major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, Dallas and Atlanta, as well as smaller communities including Pittsburgh, Raleigh and Nashville. The nation's capital is heavily represented, with D.C., Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburb of Montgomery County also making the cut. Amazon has said it is seeking an international hub with strong educational institutions and high quality of life that can support as many as 50,000 future employees. To staff the headquarters, Amazon has said it expects to hire tens of thousands of managers, software engineers, accountants, and legal and administrative workers. The company projects that it may need as many as 8 million square feet of space to house its new offices. (Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.);

no_fact; DETROIT - Inside the tournament hall of the Cobo Center, a cavernous 2.4 million square foot convention center best known as the home of the North American International Auto Show, the scene at The Big House Super Smash Bros. tournament was the same as ever. Players and fans mingled freely on the floor of the esports event, competing and cheering as beloved Nintendo characters sent each other flying off the screen. At the door, however, was a reminder that smaller-scale, locally organized esports events such as this have entered a sad new chapter.Before they could stand shoulder to shoulder around consoles and monitors, the tournament&rsquo;s attendees had to first form a line outside the hall&rsquo;s only access point. There they had to surrender their bags for search and pass through security guards with metal detector wands -- one of them armed. Such is the immediate impact of the shooting at a Madden NFL tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., in which a tournament participant, David Katz, killed two competitors, wounded 11 others and then took his own life.The shooting took place in a similar type of video gaming tournament as The Big House. Though each tournaments feature different games and are of different sizes, both are intimate events held in a public setting with little extravagance and, until the Jacksonville shooting, little security. Now grassroots-organized tournaments must face the specter of gun violence in America, and the increased costs required by new security measures.News of the late-August shooting in Jacksonville was a shock to tournament organizer Robin Harn. &ldquo;It definitely hit harder for me as an event organizer seeing that happen,&rdquo; Harn, 27, said in a phone interview.Harn, who also goes by the player name &ldquo;Juggleguy,&rdquo; was 19 when he hosted the first Big House at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.; no_fact;
no_fact; Harn said the increased security resulted in additional costs in the four-figure range, but felt all these measures were necessary to ensure the safety of attendees.&ldquo;It definitely makes me feel more safe. More organizers should be doing bag checks and stuff like this because it does worry me, hearing what&rsquo;s happened before,&rdquo; said player Goma Miqueli, 20, who traveled from Cleveland.That peace of mind was echoed by several other players. But while the security measures at The Big House, though increased from past years, were far from foolproof. There were no metal detectors other than the wands, and guards did not wand every person to enter, leaving open the potential for someone to sneak in a concealed weapon.Putting players at ease is crucial for tournaments like The Big House, as it helps assure that participation -- and in turn ticket sales and registration fees -- remains high. This is particularly true given the increased expenditures. The additional security costs narrowed profits this year, but despite the increased cost, Harn did not increase ticket prices.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to [pass] an extra cost to attendees, especially because we were already in the middle of registration season,&rdquo; Harn said before the event. &ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s just an expense I have to swallow this year.; no_fact;
no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; But, it&rsquo;s a part of the territory.&rdquo;The increased security was deemed particularly necessary given the wide-open nature of the event. Super Smash Bros. tournaments like The Big House are open to anyone who wants to participate, meaning that everyone, from established star players to relatively anonymous newcomers, must compete in qualifying rounds. This is unlike events for some other esports leagues, where teams sit backstage and are separated from fans by venue security.Ryan &ldquo;La Luna&rdquo; Coker-Welch, a professional Super Smash Bros. Melee player for Misfits, an esports team owned by the Miami Heat, acknowledges that the open nature of fighting game tournaments could potentially put players at risk.&ldquo;I kind of get a little bit worried because some people are just -- they kind of don&rsquo;t think logical, or kind of have a psychological problem. So it&rsquo;s kind of nerve-racking,&rdquo; said before the tournament. Coker-Welch does not feel, however, that things have gotten so out of control that he can&rsquo;t continue to pursue his passion.&ldquo;Me personally, like a lot of other players, an incident like Jacksonville will never ever discourage me to become the best,&rdquo; he said. Noah Smith reported from Detroit. Imad Khan reported from New York.; an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent.;

no_fact; no_fact; no_fact;
no_fact; no_fact; The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".;

Country music, also known as  country and western (or simply country), and hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk and Western music) and blues.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.According to Lindsey Starnes, the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.; there are only 2 African Americans in the Country Music Hall of Fame;
&ldquo;Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian, my two co-producers, made this record with me, and we poured everything we have into this. And I&rsquo;m so proud of it. It&rsquo;s inspired by just this beautiful universe, all of you and just most of all, love.&rdquo;While Musgraves&rsquo;s win is significant for her career (&ldquo;Golden Hour,&rdquo; which has sold about 107,000 copies since its release in March, is now back near the top of the all-genre iTunes charts), it&rsquo;s also a big deal for the industry. As you may know, country music has received a lot of backlash in recent years for its very visible gender imbalance. Women only make up approximately 10 percent of the songs played on country radio; streaming playlists and festival lineups are also skewed male. Even the CMA Awards were spare on female nominees, with an all-men entertainer of the year category for the second consecutive year.Fairchild&rsquo;s pointed dedication to &ldquo;all the little girls writing songs out there&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t just a fun aside &mdash; she has been vocal about the challenges women face in the genre. The comment also brings to mind Carrie Underwood&rsquo;s recent interview with the podcast &ldquo;Women Want to Hear Women,&rdquo; in which the superstar confessed she doesn&rsquo;t know what to say to young girls who want to be country singers.&ldquo;What do you tell them?; no_fact; no_fact; country music legend George Strait and the wealthiest man in the world Jeff Bezos are cousins.;

no_fact; Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width.Radio systems need a transmitter to modulate (change) some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using amplitude modulation or angle modulation (which can be frequency modulation or phase modulation).Radio systems also need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves, and radio waves into an electric current.The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected.The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna.A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.;

no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; Supporters of President Trump at a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Thursday. (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) Not everyone who attended President Trump's campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Thursday was a fervent Trump supporter. Asked how they would rate Trump on a scale from 1 to 10, some respondents ranked him as low as an 8. (Others, of course, gave him a 10 or an 11 or an 11? or a 20.) There were concerns about his implementation of tariffs, though not from John, 30, a soybean farmer who didn't give his last name. He saw the tariffs as "a small loss for a big-time gain." There were concerns about his tweeting, though not from Mike Connolly, 33, who said that he "liked his Twitter usage," saying Twitter was Trump's "only mouthpiece where he can get by everybody else." Generally, though, attitudes toward Trump mirrored Connolly's broader summation. "I love the president. I love his agenda," Connolly said. "Love what he's doing for America. Everything he said two years ago when I was in this exact parking lot, he's been doing." The friends who were with him whistled and clapped. There's an all-or-nothing aspect to a lot of the Trump support expressed by those who were waiting to hear him speak, often accepting - or at least agreeing with - the president's representations of how his administration is faring.; no_fact;

But the mother throwing the party was not just another loving parent. She was the wife of the biggest name in drug trafficking. As first reported by the Los Angeles Times this week, Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of alleged Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaqu?n "El Chapo" Guzm?n, posted the images from the 7th birthday party for the couple's twin daughters. The images drew the usual social media rubbernecking but also outrage. Awaiting trial in U.S. custody, Guzm?n is alleged to have run a vicious billion-dollar narcotics empire that had nearly complete control of the American illegal drug supply and left behind a significant body count. But as the alleged kingpin stews in a cell, his wife is hosting parties with the blood money. "You know that this was not possible without who knows how many deaths and tortures in Mexico, right?" one poster commented in Spanish under Coronel's party pictures.

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.;

[Maryland's marijuana dispensaries are already running out of pot] Maryland, where recreational marijuana remains illegal for now, is debating how to regulate advertising for medical cannabis. On Thursday, the state's Medical Cannabis Commission approved restrictions that include a ban on advertising via radio, television and billboards, as well as through social media that fail to verify the user is at least 18 years old. The proposed regulations will be submitted for legislative review. The commission reported $96 million in medical cannabis sales during the market's first year of operation.

The Falcons twice drove to the doorstep of the Eagles' goal line in the opening quarter, yet emerged with only three points. Ryan wasn't playing like a former league MVP. Foles was resembling the journeyman he'd been for much of his NFL career rather than a Super Bowl standout. The on-field misery continued into the third quarter. The game needed something. Anything. And then Pederson dialed up some of that trademark trickery. The 15-yard strike from Agholor to Foles energized the crowd. It seemed to do the same for the Eagles.

The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919, and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.

Since returning from suspension in Week 3, Aaron Jones of the Green Bay Packers has carried the ball 17 times for 107 yards and a touchdown. (Dylan Buell/Getty Images) It pays to be different. According to Mark Gallant of the Action Network, contrarian bettors are off to their best start through the first four weeks of the season since 2003, the first year data is available. Teams garnering more than half of the money wagered are 23-38-1 against the spread and those with more than 70 percent of the betting market's dollars are just 3-9. Our league-projection formula helps determine how often one team should beat another based on its actual and projected win rates. That gives us win probabilities for every game, as well as an implied margin of victory - helpful for picking games against the spread.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).;
Though events in Iran are murky, their direction is historic. The Iranian regime - which has made a project of destabilizing others through terrorism and regional adventurism - has been revealed as deeply unstable. Many Iranian citizens thought that the election of the "moderate" Hassan Rouhani as president would bring more sensible and effective governance. Those hopes have fizzled. Many Iranians thought that the nuclear deal's sanctions relief and unfrozen assets would improve their lives. For the most part, they haven't. The result - put in terms President Trump would appreciate - has been a broad revolt against the Iranian political establishment. The Iranian government's problem is no longer a matter of performance but of legitimacy. Routine corruption, vicious oppression and economic mismanagement are increasingly seen as essential to the regime itself.

Instead of being concentrated in Tehran and a few other cities, the current unrest can be found across the country in smaller cities and rural areas. (If it comes to it, this would complicate the imposition of martial law, because Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps would need to be deployed more thinly.) "In 100 years," Iranian dissident Mohsen Sazegara told me, "we've never had such a movement all around the country." The geographic and demographic scope of the protests is what makes them so remarkable - and so damaging to the long-term prospects of the regime. The short-term prospects are a different matter. Those who hope that the Iranian national revolution will succeed in a single, big push - like the crowd turning against the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in Palace Square - are likely to be disappointed. In most civil-resistance movements, the purpose of mass protest is not to overthrow the government directly. It is to convince observers - and especially elements of the police and army - that they can turn against the regime without imprisonment or death. Protests act as a signal to potential defectors that their risk is reasonable. If enough people join them, the chance of violence diminishes. This depends on the protesters rejecting violence themselves.; 5 Presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. Greatest margin 10%;

DuVernay has a wealth of comic book treasures to utilize with the "New Gods," from the initial run of Kirby and the late '90s works of John Byrne to the current critically acclaimed "Mister Miracle" miniseries from Washington-based writer Tom King and artist Mitch Gerads. Fans will no doubt be anticipating the drama of Darkseid and Orion's complicated father-son relationship. Orion was raised in New Genesis and taught to believe that the ways of his father's world of Apokolips are wrong. But at times Darkseid's DNA can take control of his temper, in contrast to Darkseid's typically calm demeanor alongside the chaos of his world. Mister Miracle would be expected to be a master escape artist, and Big Barda could have a Wonder Womanlike impact on a "New Gods" film, given her strength and fearlessness. [New DC Comics imprint DC Black Label will give creators the power to tell new, legendary tales] In 2015, it was widely reported that DuVernay was in contention to be the director of Marvel Studios' billion-dollar behemoth "Black Panther." That role eventually went to "Creed" director Ryan Coogler after DuVernay took herself out of consideration for the job. Now this "New Gods" news distracts slightly from the buzz of Marvel Studios's new "Avengers: Infinity War" trailer, which dropped Friday morning.;
Whether that was an intentional move by DC against its rival is hard to say, but surely DC has to be happy with the (for now) positive movie news trending online. Any live-action "New Gods" movie would be an expensive, CGI-heavy production, two facets with which DuVernay is very familiar after directing "A Wrinkle in Time" for Disney. A "New Gods" movie represents the type of bold decision-making that shows WB/DC will not let previous failures and polarizing films stop them from trying to return to their glory days of superhero movie making. The DC Extended Universe has seen other hopeful signs recently. Patty Jenkins's "Wonder Woman" was a hit and has led to a soon-to-be-in-production sequel, and there's the hope that James Wan's "Aquaman" (starring Jason Momoa and coming to theaters this November) will have the same impact. "Shazam!" is in production (starring Zachary Levi), but so far leaked photos aren't inspiring much fanboy approval.

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.; no_fact;

The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America; composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.; no_fact;
no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

Since our furniture was going to be pushed to the center of each room, why not lighten the load? I'm in the "out of sight, out of mind" school. God invented things with doors - cabinets, dressers - so you could keep stuffing your possessions inside and forget about them. Ruth was having none of it. The books, especially, were a problem. Did we want to move them all twice: off the bookshelves and into the basement, and then out of the basement and back to the bookshelves? Some, sure: the first-edition of Orwell's "1984." But if I hadn't yet read that hardback on the history of peanut butter, was I ever going to read it? So, some books were set aside to donate. Other household items were thrown away during a trip to the transfer station. That's always satisfying. You get to open the back of your car and just toss stuff out. I tell you, no Artemis loosed an arrow with as much grace as Ruth did when she flung an old metal hamper frame into a pile of broken refrigerators and rusting window AC units, where it landed with a satisfying "clang." But getting rid of an old metal hamper frame is one thing. My records, CDs and cassette tapes are another. They're personal. Not that I was totally averse to pruning. I could accept that there was some duplication.;
An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium. Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records  played at ​33 1⁄3 rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used alongside vinyl from the 1970s into the first decade of the 2000s.;

Unlike an iTunes playlist, each one took at least as long to assemble as it did to listen to. There was no dragging and dropping with a mix tape. There was no sending the track list to the inkjet, either. You had to handwrite each song title and artist. Or artist, then title. And commas to separate? Or semicolons? Whatever mix tapes I made for old girlfriends are, like the girlfriends themselves, long gone: in their closets or basements or nearest landfills. (The tapes, not the girlfriends.) What I had were stacks of party tapes. These had been crafted with care - and no small amount of wishful thinking. Side One of Tape One would start slow and mellow - guest-arrival music - then build in tempo and intensity until somewhere around Tape Three the bacchanalia soundtrack kicked in. That was the idea, anyway. These days, I guess it's easier just to say, "Alexa: Play orgy music." Of course, I never would. Wouldn't want to mess up the new paint.

I started with LPs that Ruth and I both owned that had somehow nestled together for 30 years. I saved the better copy, unless Ruth had written on the inner sleeve of the other one, fixing typos or correcting erroneous lyrics, in which case I saved that one as a reminder that My Lovely Wife has always been the sort of person who proofreads liner notes. CDs I was never going to listen to went in the giveaway pile, too. That included three year's worth of the CD samplers that came every month with College Music Journal. This saddened me. But even if I binge-listened to all of it, it would only provide me with a grounding of alternative music of the mid-1990s. I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna ask me now what I think of Chumbawamba or Superchunk. Then there were the cassette tapes. People make fun of that obsolete technology today, but there was a time when it was cutting edge. Or cutting middle, anyway. The cassette tape was the birth control pill of personal audio, symbolizing freedom and choice: Listen to it in your home, on your person, in your car! And when it got tangled and mangled in the tape deck of your Toyota Tercel, roll down the window and chuck it out, holding a bit of the brown ribbon between your fingers as you let it unspool in the slipstream. So, I have a fondness for cassettes. But even I had to admit that a TDK dub of Marshall Crenshaw's debut album was surplus when I also had it on vinyl and CD (and iTunes). Out it went. But what do you do with a mix tape? Those musical scrapbooks expressed real personality. They also represented real toil.;

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.There are costs and benefits to car use.The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986.;

Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.  Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.; no_fact;

no_fact; Are you tired of coming up with small talk with strangers over Tinder messages? Of course you are. Instead, the System pairs people instantly and picks the meetup spot. Back in 2013, OkCupid tried something like this: an app called Crazy Blind Date, where profile photos were displayed as a scrambled image. Users would input the times they had available to meet up and preferred locations. The app would then either set people up blindly or allow them to schedule with another user based on the times and locations they had on offer. It sounds like a brilliant way to do an end-run around endless predate conversing, but OkCupid got a lot of backlash over the app. Why? Well, one of the reasons people often don't want to go on dates immediately with strangers from the Internet is that they want to make sure they'll be safe - and often picking a public place isn't enough to ensure that. However, in the serene yet sanitized world Frank and Amy find themselves in, the danger seems to come not from their dates but from the security officers stalking about with stun guns. Everyone seems to be looking for the same thing: a relationship. What a concept.;
When Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole) get paired on an online dating app in a "Black Mirror" episode, they are told immediately that their relationship will last 12 hours. (Jonathan Prime/Netflix) To some, the singles scene has already hit apocalyptic territory. So what would a fictional dating dystopia look like? In its fourth season, the Netflix series "Black Mirror" makes a pretty good guess. Its episode follows Frank (Joe Cole) and Amy (Georgina Campbell), who are stuck in an online dating experiment called the System, which pairs users off for finite amounts of time (anywhere from 12 hours to several years) while collecting data on their preferences so that it can one day deliver their one true love. At first "Hang the DJ's" premise appears to be a more cheerful version of "The Lobster," a dark comedy about a hotel where singles are sent to meet their match, or else. After 45 days, those who don't find a suitable mate get turned into the animal of their choosing. It took the idea of "dying alone" to frightening heights. Even if the constant pairings in "Hang the DJ" seem like drudgery, the episode is far more optimistic than "The Lobster." Even as Frank and Amy drudge through unsatisfying matches, success seems more inevitable than a lifetime of loneliness. In fact, there are a few elements in "Hang the DJ's" fictional universe that, at least at first glance, might seem like improvements on the real-life Tinder slog. Singles get to meet each other right away.;

The horrors of which are obvious when you see how miserable some of the Frank and Amy's other matches are. You have lots of options, but you know you'll end up with the best. When the dangers of online dating are discussed in real life, the paradox of choice comes up.

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

Minimum-wage laws have had little impact on healthy businesses.But let&rsquo;s face it, much of America&rsquo;s restaurant mania is about entertainment, not sustenance.

[The fight over Initiative 77 gets more heated]It&rsquo;s at the restaurants that are more about sustenance &mdash; like the diners and coffee shops my mom worked at most of her life &mdash; where tips shine a light on the most vulnerable of this 2.6&nbsp;million-person workforce.A busy day at a coffee shop means a hustle in $1 and $2 increments. It&rsquo;s hardly the makings of a three-figure tips day. So for those folks, relying on the good graces of tippers is a dodgy way to make a living.Remember, my lifelong snooping tells me that about 30&nbsp;percent of people will get away without tipping fairly &mdash; or at all &mdash; if they can.The Washington business community and the D.C. Council are largely against the measure, siding with the current culture of tipping as enough.Maybe, but I always come back to what columnist and author Dave Barry calls the Waiter Rule, which has nothing to do with tipping. It says, &ldquo;A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a rule often invoked by business folks as a hiring test.For instance, a candidate interviewing for a general counsel position lost the job when she was &ldquo;amazingly rude&rdquo; to someone cleaning tables during the interview, Panera Bread founder and chief executive Ron Shaich told USA Today.It&rsquo;s also a good guideline when choosing a potential bae. If they&rsquo;re rude to the restaurant waitstaff, drop them.But perhaps we are a city of optimists, where everyone passes the Waiter Rule &mdash; and tips generously. I sure hope so, because we&rsquo;re about to find out. Twitter: @petulad;

(Twentieth Century Fox). What marks Patty Jenkins's "Wonder Woman" and James Mangold's "Logan" are not simply stellar performances with great chemistry and engaging action. Both beautifully shot films nod openly to their influences from other genres. "Wonder Woman" borrows from screwball comedies and the derring-do adventure of Indiana Jones, and "Logan" aesthetically quotes Westerns such as "Shane" and Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy. Such genre cross-pollination might make both films more appealing to academy voters who otherwise wouldn't look twice at superhero fare.

(Warner Bros./DC Entertainment) BATMAN'S FAILURE a decade ago just might vault his DC teammate Wonder Woman to success today. As the 2018 Oscars nomination balloting concludes Friday, it bears noting that no true superhero film - including 2008's acclaimed "The Dark Knight" - has ever been nominated for the best-picture prize. Yes, despite all the attention paid to the box-office domination of superhero cinema in recent years - six of the top 11 films in 2017 sprung from caped comic books, for instance - the spandex set still cannot quite get invited to the biggest dance. Sure, superhero movies have received dozens of nominations for music and makeup, sound and score, but best picture has proved elusive even for well-regarded hits such as "Superman" and "Iron Man." The nominated 1985 drama "Kiss of the Spider Woman" had a far better shot politically than any of the "Spider-Man" movies; 2004's stellar "The Incredibles" had to settle for best animated feature (as well as sound and screenplay nods); and it was a biting satire of the superhero-performance business, "Birdman," that actually won the big Oscars prize in 2015. The irony, of course, is that "Birdman" so smartly played off star Michael Keaton's history as a big-screen Batman, kicking off the second wave in superhero film.;

Literature, most generically, is any body of written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera: letter or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature), and non-written verbal art forms. Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature.; there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.; there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.;

Sweeping past skeletal trees, the rider looks larger than life: His colossal steed moves with strides that are simultaneously exuberant and menacing. The tableau seems to point not only to the existence of a ghostly realm, but also to the idea (central to Irving&rsquo;s 19th-century story &ldquo;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&rdquo;) that fear has momentum and magnifying properties. The galloping sequence is just one of the pulse-quickening effects in this production, the latest in Synetic&rsquo;s wordless adaptations of classics. Directed by Paata Tsikurishvili, with choreography by Irina Tsikurishvili, &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow&rdquo; also includes rousing fight scenes (complete with vaulting leaps and full-body throws); a nifty slow-motion riptide that carries characters back in time; and a scene in which the Headless Horseman (Scott S. Turner) generates a maelstrom of disembodied noggins. &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t equal to the very best work by Synetic, the troupe known for daring theatrical movement and visual coups. The visually arresting touches here sometimes seem purely sensationalistic, rather than also reflecting deep truths about society, human behavior and literature. Still, there is nothing aesthetically dozy about &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow.&rdquo; Brittany DilibertoKonstantine Lortkipanidze plays the piano onstage, quasi-headless.

no_fact; The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. ;

Life Time clubs, which are currently located in 36 major markets in the U.S. and Canada, also have WiFi, meaning members can watch news on their own devices as they please. Life Time, founded in 1992 by Bahram Akradi, touts a "healthy and happy life for its members," according to its website. It aims to provide a comprehensive experience "that goes well beyond fitness to encompass the entire spectrum of daily life for individuals, couples and families of all ages." Numerous studies have indeed shown that consumption of emotional content of TV news can affect a person's mental health and mood, according to Graham C.L. Davey, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Sussex. "Our studies also showed that this change in mood exacerbates the viewers own personal worries - even when those worries are not directly relevant to the news stories being broadcast," Davis said in an email to The Washington Post. One study described in the Harvard Business Review found that people who watched just three minutes of negative news in the morning had a 27 percent greater likelihood of reporting their day as unhappy six to eight hours later, compared to a group that watched positive news focused on uplifting stories of resilience. Several Life Time members on Twitter praised the gym chain's decision to remove cable news networks, with some saying they already feel less stressed during their workouts. The gym, wrote one member, "is no place for constant negativity like the news chains love to surround themselves with." Thank you!

For some, particularly amid today's high-velocity news cycle, this daily routine may involve hitting a treadmill or elliptical machine while catching up on cable TV networks. But one nationwide fitness chain has decided that the combination of cardio and cable news does not align with a "healthy way of life." Life Time Fitness, a Minnesota-based gym chain, has decided to eliminate all national cable network news stations from the TV screens at its 128 fitness centers in the U.S. and Canada. The removed channels include CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and CNBC, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. The decision, which was made at the start of the new year, came after a wave of feedback from gym members over time, Life Time said in a statement on Twitter last week. It also stemmed from the chain's "commitment to provide family oriented environments free of consistently negative or politically charged content," the statement read. "It is always our goal to meet the majority of members' expressed requests and we believe this change is consistent with the desires of overall membership as well as our healthy way of life philosophy," the statement read. The big-screen TVs at all clubs will now air "USA, A&E, Discovery and HGTV, in addition to local stations and ESPN," spokeswoman Natalie Bushaw told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. These TVs can be seen throughout the fitness areas, but can only be heard through headphones. Some personal TV screens built into the clubs' cardio machines have the ability to display cable news channels, Bushaw told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and Life Time plans to make these available at all stations by the end of February.;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

The Cardinals' defense also has some up-close experience with Peterson after he finished last season with the team. That's not an advantage, though, according to Wilks. "AP is AP,' Wilks said. "He's tough, he's hard-nosed, he's physical, and he's going to run with a mission. As I just talked about, we have to do a great job tackling and getting off blocks. So, he's going to be ready to play, I know that for a fact, and we are going to have our hands full." Ultimately, the success of the ground game will be predicated on more than just the individuals in the running backs room. Gruden is known for his passing schematics, but he needs to keep defenses honest. Offensive lines typically prefer to be aggressively run blocking instead of going backward while pass blocking. "It's not like basketball where you've got one man that can score 30 points and change the game," Moses said. "It takes all 11. When you had as much change-up with the offensive line and guys on IR, it just takes away that chemistry.

Adrian Peterson carries in a preseason game against Denver. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Inside the Washington Redskins running back room, everyone has something to prove. Adrian Peterson is out to show that, at 33 years old, he can still be one of the elite backs in the game. Chris Thompson is angling to be the NFL's best third-down back and the comeback player of the year. Rob Kelley wants to stop being the fallback option in constant need of upgrading. Samaje Perine aims to deliver on the promise that made him a fourth-round pick in 2017. The Redskins have not ranked higher than 19th in the NFL in rushing under Coach Jay Gruden, but they enter this season intent on improving on the 90.5 yards per game that ranked 28th last season. "Everybody's just eager," Kelley said. " . . . Everybody's excited. Made some changes around the locker room, and everybody just wants to prove that we belong. "It's a pride issue.

Last year, a tiger cub bought by a U.S. teenager was intercepted at a checkpoint in California. In 2010, border agents recovered a caged and abandoned tiger in Laredo, another Texas border town. And a decade ago, six tiger cubs were recovered from an attempted sale at a Walmart parking lot, also in Brownsville. They appeared to be southbound for Mexico, local media reported at the time. deMaar said those six cubs were also delivered to Gladys Porter Zoo - an inadvertent collection point for tigers caught in an international smuggling ring. Three are still at the zoo, he said, and two others were sent to a sanctuary. The sixth tiger died. About 350 million plants and animals are sold around the world annually, generating between $7 billion and $23 billion, Washington-based conservation group Defenders of Wildlife said in a 2015 report. Latin America has emerged as a fulcrum in the endangered and exotic species trade feeding the booming U.S. market, the group's senior international counsel Alejandra Goyenechea told The Post. A quarter of the 50,000 animals and wildlife products seized at U.S. ports of entry from 2005 to 2014 originated in Latin America, the group found in the report, which Goyenechea co-authored. Smugglers move freely through corruption-plagued nations and exploit the sometimes-porous border with Mexico to send endangered animals and illegal animal products into the United States. And they tend to use trade routes already traversed by drug, weapon and human smugglers, a highway of sorts of illegal activity.;

And Mexican parrots are endangered by the demand for protected and rare birds, like the vividly colored orange-fronted and yellow-headed species. Many smugglers rely on methods less conspicuous than black duffel bags carried by hand. Last March, federal agents intercepted a shipment of cobras hidden in potato chip cans. While methods of stuffing animals into containers and luggage may be helpful to smugglers, the confinement is dangerous, Goyenechea said. Many animals die in transit from suffocation or hunger, and others are injured. That is not lost on smugglers. To sell a single animal, traders will collect some species at a factor of 3, 5 or even 10 because some of the animals are expected to perish along the way, she said. "It's an additional threat to wildlife," Goyenechea said.; no_fact; Last year, a tiger cub bought by a U.S. teenager was intercepted at a checkpoint in California.

no_fact; Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

The use of anonymous sources to provide important information necessary to advance the public's understanding of events is often crucial. But this practice was once rare and usually involved long discussions among top editors; today, it's grossly abused for such trivial nonsense as telling us what mood the president was in on Tuesday. Such was the case with the piece published by the Times, whose author advanced no new information but did manage to show an amazing lack of concern for fellow administration officials, all of whom were put under a cloud of suspicion and forced into the unenviable position of having to deny authorship. Thanks for nothing. At least one generation of Americans has grown up knowing nothing but a world in which it is deemed acceptable to think up a fake name, log on to the World Wide Web and begin hurling insults. It is indefensible, as was the Times's decision to jump on the bandwagon in an even bigger display of recklessness. "We believe publishing this essay anonymously is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers," wrote Times editors. No, there was another way, a way that involved getting someone on the record - someone accountable and identifiable, even at the risk of his or her job. If something is truly worth saying, it is worth the risk that accompanies saying it. One whole generation may be lost, but the next deserves to grow up understanding why accountability matters.;

Cheering crowds greeted American actress Meghan Markle and fiance Prince Harry in front of Cardiff Castle Jan. 18 during their first official visit to Wales. (Reuters) LONDON - Prince Harry and his fiancee, Meghan Markle, carried out their first official visit to Wales on Thursday amid speculation about who will score an invitation to their upcoming nuptials - and who won't. Arriving about an hour late because their train was delayed, Harry and Markle began their day in Cardiff, the Welsh capital, with a walkabout, greeting members of the public who had gathered outside Cardiff Castle. News commentators described Markle as "a natural" with the crowds. And "Meghan mania" was how they described the response to her. Prince Harry - a.k.a. His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales - and his American bride-to-be experienced a taste of Welsh culture during their tour. They sampled Welsh cakes, listened to a Welsh boys choir and were presented with Welsh love spoons. The Cardiff visit was part of a tour of British towns and cities the couple are making ahead of their wedding.;

British tabloids have reported that May's government is worried that inviting the former U.S. president and his wife, Michelle, could further strain diplomatic ties. Prince Harry recently sidestepped an inquiry about whether the Obamas could expect an invitation in their mailbox, given the prince's friendship with Barack Obama. The prince interviewed Obama for a segment that ran on BBC radio in late December, and after the prerecorded interview aired, a BBC presenter posed the delicate question. "We haven't even put the invites or the guest lists together yet, so who knows whether he could be invited or not?" Harry said. "I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise." Harry and Markle's public appearance in Cardiff marks their third official visit together. Earlier this month, they visited a radio station in the south London neighborhood of Brixton, where they received a raucously enthisastic reception. Shortly after they announced their engagement, they visited Nottingham on World AIDS Day, a visit that also drew large crowds.;

Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humour.These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception).One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound.When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.Comedy, compared with other film genres, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity.While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog).;

The series features a supremely funny ensemble cast, including Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Stephanie Beatriz and Chelsea Peretti, but the complicated relationship between Peralta and Holt was set up as a central theme from the beginning. "Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles," Sgt. Terry Jeffords (Crews) told Holt in the pilot, as he arrives for his first day as the precinct's new captain. "The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up." "That was very well put," Holt said approvingly. From then on, he made it his mission to turn Peralta into a mature adult, while Peralta balked at every step of the way. They eventually both formed a grudging respect for the other, and one of the funniest parts of the show has been seeing the two wildly opposite characters bond - even if they drive each other crazy. (Think Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson from "Parks and Recreation": The two shows share a co-creator, Michael Schur.) Peralta, who has lots of father issues, once accidentally called Holt "dad," much to the mockery of the squad. Guest star Sterling K. Brown on "Brooklyn Nine-Nine.";

Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.;

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.; no_fact; "Why should I not go No. 1?"

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

no_fact; As Rothstein points out, he also hadn't threatened violence against anyone, save for slapping a cellphone out of his mother's hand. But SWAT teams aren't psychiatrists. SWAT teams are groups of police officers who are trained to use overwhelming force and violence to subdue a threat. Predictably, this SWAT team did not do what a psychiatrist would do; they did what SWAT teams do. A hostage negotiator had persuaded him to let the child go home with his mother and was standing on the front porch with the boy, a car seat and a backpack full of clothes when Zaro told the SWAT team not to allow him to go back inside with the child and gave Wiley approval to breach the back door with explosives. The blast startled Thomas, and when he reached for the child, Markert shot him. Later, Markert would file a report - with the help of an attorney - that referred to the child as a hostage more than 100 times and insisted Thomas was trying to strangle the child. Rothstein said the jury clearly concluded otherwise. "But [the child] was not a hostage, and Markert and the other officers here were not attempting to separate him from a kidnapper," she said. "Rather, they were attempting to remove a child from his parent without the parent's consent" and at the cost of the parent's life. And now that child has no father.; no_fact;

Am I wrong for thinking that certain topics, such as politics and religion, should be off-limits when one is unaware of another's affiliations? I know that social media has made it easier for people to be more vocal about what they believe while hiding behind a screen, but I feel it is inappropriate to bring up the subjects unless one knows how those they are conversing with stand. The old rule about not discussing politics and religion seemed so antiquated until recent years, didn't it? Miss Manners is hereby resurrecting it and recommending that you ask your employees to observe it - and that you adhere to it yourself, despite the admitted temptation offered by those whose clothing tries to provoke such conversations. Dear Miss Manners: My husband and I live in a very small one-bedroom apartment. We rarely entertain because of our space limitations. However, we have a dear friend who lives several hours away and comes to visit us a few times a year, generally for a day or two. His last visit occurred during the week, while I worked.

That point would have been the first time your guest stirred and said hello. Or at the start of your workday. Having been duly warned that you needed to work the next day, your guest should have taken pains to wake up early. Since he did not, Miss Manners finds you within your jurisdiction to announce, at the slightest stirring (or not), "Oh, are you up? Sorry, I am afraid that I have to turn on the light and get some work done. I hope it will not disturb you.'' New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

no_fact; Dear Miss Manners: I live in a liberal college town in a more conservative state. So there's a large mix, and I suppose you could call the overall atmosphere "moderate.'' It's hard to know where people stand on an issue unless they're wearing a T-shirt or have a bumper sticker that announces it. As I work in customer service, I interact with a lot of people, both as customers (obviously) and as new employees. One new employee, in her late teens or early 20s, saw a customer wearing a shirt with a religious message. She said something to me about it, seeming to think I would agree with her, though I said nothing. As we helped the customer, I told her that I liked her shirt. Later, the new girl seemed a bit irked with me and lectured me that she was agnostic - explaining what that was, even though I already knew. I explained that I tend to adopt a "live and let live'' attitude about other religions. Should she have made the comment she did to me, not knowing what I believe?; no_fact;
A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments.In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a "dress shirt", a specific type of "collared shirt").A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.; the official business and office attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie;

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

no_fact; Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning. It is a form of language processing.Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.;

(Air Force) Moments after Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Neil C. Roberts fell from a battle-damaged helicopter onto a snowy mountain in Afghanistan, Air Force Tech. Sgt. John A. Chapman and his Navy SEAL teammates made a fateful decision: They would scramble back to Roberts on another aircraft, knowing that al-Qaeda fighters were closing in. The ensuing battle at Takur Ghar was one of the ugliest near the outset of the Afghanistan war, and it was examined at length by the U.S. military after the deaths of Roberts, Chapman and five other elite U.S. service members. But the Pentagon now says that for years, official accounts did not recognize Chapman's final moments and how he sacrificed his life in an attempt to save fellow U.S. troops on an incoming helicopter that was about to be ambushed by al-Qaeda fighters.; no_fact;

A video posted by the U.S. military recreated the events leading up to the death of Medal of Honor nominee Sgt. John A. Chapman. (Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs) On Wednesday, Chapman will become the first member of the Air Force to be recognized with the Medal of Honor - the nation's highest award for valor in combat - since the Vietnam War. Navy SEALs fighting alongside Chapman thought he was dead when they were forced down the mountain under a hail of enemy fire, but he was unconscious and awoke to fight militants alone for another hour before he was killed March 4, 2002. The determination was made after a 30-month investigation. In 2002, Chapman posthumously received the Air Force Cross - second only to the Medal of Honor in his service - for climbing up a steep hill under fire in the battle and killing at least two militants inside a bunker on top. But former Air Force secretary Deborah James recommended - and President Trump approved - an upgrade after an examination of drone video footage and interviews with service members who monitored his final moments by radio and powerful aircraft sensors. Tech. Sgt.; no_fact; John Chapman was killed in Afghanistan in 2002 while attempting to rescue a Navy SEAL. (Air Force) "John was the only American that was alive on the mountaintop, and there was somebody fighting for an hour," an Air Force officer involved in the investigation told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the secretive nature of his unit. "Somebody on the top of the bunker continued to engage the enemy." The investigation opened old wounds in the close-knit Special Operations world, as the New York Times first reported two years ago. The Pentagon long ago recognized Chapman, Air Force Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham and Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt K. Slabinski with awards just below the Medal of Honor for their valor in the battle, but was it forced to confront the conclusion that the SEAL team led by Slabinski mistakenly left Chapman behind. [As a Navy SEAL receives the Medal of Honor, frustrations remain about a related case] James has accused senior U.S. Special Operations officers of slow-rolling Chapman's upgrade out of concern for how it would reflect on the SEALs. The White House announced Chapman's Medal of Honor but only after recognizing Slabinski, who went on to retire as a master chief petty officer, with the same award in May. U.S. military officials have declined to comment on the controversy, while Slabinski told Breaking Defense in an interview in May that he was "looking for some sign, some movement, any sign of life" from Chapman in the battle and that "I didn't get anything out of John." Chapman, 36, was an elite Air Force combat controller assigned to Slabinski's SEAL team to call in airstrikes, and was the father of two young girls.; no_fact;

the creator of the Python programming language named it partly to honor British comedy group Monty Python; In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.;

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).;

Birds, also known as Aves,  are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically-successful class of tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species, more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.; crows are amongst the most intelligent of birds, and are even capable of imitating human speech.;

A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.  Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact;
no_fact; The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth and is Earth's only permanent natural satellite.The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.After the Sun, the Moon is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky.The Moon's average orbital distance is 384,402 km (238,856 mi), or 1.28 light-seconds.The Moon's apparent size in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar distance and diameter.This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.Both the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial.;

To this retro aesthetic Gao adds a potent mixture of humor and sentiment. Gao's 2011 game "To the Moon," introduced players to Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, two doctors who explore the consciousness of dying patients while burnishing their repartee. As employees of Sigmund Corps, the doctors work to grant their patients a final wish, something that can only be experienced during their last moments - when their lives flash before them - but that appears real nonetheless. (Courtesy of Freebird Games) To perform their jobs the doctors use proprietary technology to access their patients' key memories to retrieve mementos or memory markers from important moments in their lives. The doctors use these to reconstruct a path for their machine to follow the memories. Then, with a bit of technological voodoo, they create an artificial memory that causes a ripple effect throughout the patient's chain of memories to fulfill his wish. "To the Moon," which told the story of a man's wish to find peace among the stars, was the first game I played that elicited a near teary-eyed response when I finished it. (In fact, there is a YouTube clip of popular streamers misting up.) Since "To the Moon's" release there have been two mini-episodes about interpersonal incidents that occur over one day during the holidays at Sigmund Corps.;

no_fact; Birds, also known as Aves,  are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago.DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages.The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life.Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction.Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them.;

no_fact; An action performed by Dr. Watts during one of these mini-episodes has consequences that appear in Gao's newest game "Finding Paradise." This recently released full-fledged sequel was preceded by "A Bird Story" (2014) a short, vibrant tale about a lonely boy who befriends an injured bird. The boy, Colin, grows into the patient whose last wish is at the center of "Finding Paradise." (Courtesy of Freebird Games) Colin's final wish is for the doctors to grant him a more fulfilling life while changing as few of his memories as possible. Like many, he has an inarticulate ache for something more. Soon after the doctors begin exploring Colin's memories, they are surprised to find that they jump from one of Colin's most recent memories to a memory of him as a child. Normally the accumulation of mementos causes them to proceed steadily backward from old age to childhood. The explanation for why they jump from the patient's mature years to his younger years and vice versa - in "the pattern of a decaying orbit" - is part of a mystery involving the unique way that Colin coped with problems - by retreating into his imagination. As the doctors close in on the crux of Colin's compensatory/defense mechanism they watch memories of poignant scenes from Colin's life. From his childhood years, they discover his regret over his lack of artistic talent; from his time as a newlywed, they see his embarrassment over spilling a drink on his wife during their honeymoon; and from his later years, they notice his longing for grandchildren.;

Quriesh Ahmad, 10, from Afghanistan practices a trick during a soccer camp for refugee children at Total Soccer Arena in Landover, Maryland. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post) A group of sweaty kids darted around a field last week at Total Soccer Arena in Landover, Maryland, covered in bits of rubber from the turf. In between shots, passes and giggles, they chatted in English, but also in Pashto, Arabic and other languages. All of the kids are refugees - people who have to leave their home countries to escape danger, such as war or a natural disaster. They were playing as part of a camp that gives them a chance to improve their soccer skills and to meet other kids who had to start their lives over in the United States. The week-long camp doesn't focus only on soccer, though - it also helps kids learn lessons that can guide them off the field, such as how to respect themselves, how to manage anger and how to value other people. The camp is run by a nonprofit organization called LACES, which stands for Life and Change Experienced Thru Sports. The group uses soccer to help bring together communities that have experienced hardships. Children and volunteers participate in the week-long camp. The event is run by Life and Change Experienced Thru Sports (LACES), a nonprofit group that helps local refu-gee communities. This year, 95 kids signed up for camp.;

no_fact; Quriesh came to the United States from Afghanistan four years ago; Monir came a year later. They said they still remember all the bombs that would go off and how the people had no electricity and were always scared. "There are a lot of people fighting in Afghanistan," Monir said. "But when I come here, I am safe." Neither of them had played soccer before they moved to Maryland, but it has become the biggest part of their American lives. Quriesh has learned his best moves by watching clips of Brazilian soccer star Neymar on YouTube. Then, because he knows practice is the way to get better, he repeats the tricks over and over. The boys loved the camp because it was a chance to practice soccer and play with kids like themselves. "When I grow up, I used to want to make houses, but now I want to be a soccer player," Quriesh said.

Fryatt, who's from Chicago, Illinois, saw that soccer brought joy to the Liberian women on her team, even though their lives off the field were very difficult. After starting a soccer program for kids in Liberia, she decided to start a similar camp in Maryland, where she moved in 2015. Coaches volunteer their time, and the costs are paid mostly by donations. This year, 95 kids signed up. The camp, for ages 9 to 14, is split between drills that help kids improve skills such as passing and shooting, and sessions where they discuss strategies for life. One of the coaches, Louisa Pitney, said she likes seeing the kids grow just from being together. The campers improve their soccer skills but also learn life skills. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post) "It's cool to see them interact and learn things from each other," Pitney said.

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; There's a bike trail below Dominion Power lines at Lake Accotink in Fairfax County, Va. The W&OD Trail in Falls Church, Va., is in the shadow of wires. In Columbia, Md., pedestrians can get around under BG&E high-tension lines. Pepco had always rejected entreaties to allow trails, citing "safety and liability considerations." Then Exelon wanted to buy the utility, and trail boosters saw an opening. "We told Pepco, 'We would support your merger if you would allow trails under your power lines,' " said Dave Magill of MORE. It helped that the state passed a law granting immunity to landowners in cases where people were injured while using their property for recreation. On Friday, it seemed like that law might get tested. Less than an hour after the new trail was dedicated, a woman took a hard fall off her bike. An ambulance was summoned to take her to the hospital. It isn't only cyclists who expect to use the trail. Gretchen Bolton was there for the ribbon cutting in a shirt that read "Puck Favement.";
no_fact; no_fact;
On Friday morning, Dagnija Kreslins stood beneath a Pepco high-voltage power line near her house in Darnestown, Md., and held a protest sign that read "HELP - Everyone looks in our windows." She had mixed feelings about a new mountain-biking and hiking trail that was being dedicated in the power line's right of way. On the one hand, the packed-dirt trail looped right in front of Kreslins's house, close enough, she thought, to allow strangers to peer into her kitchen. On the other hand, the mere fact that the trail was built vindicated the decision she and her husband made 30 years ago to buy a house right next to a skein of high-voltage wires. Friends told them they'd never be able to sell their home. "Now that there's a nature trail under the line, it's a message that it's safe," Kreslins said. The six-mile trail connects Muddy Branch Stream Valley Park to South Germantown Recreational Park and is a result of cooperation among Pepco, Montgomery County's parks department and Mid-Atlantic Off-Road Enthusiasts (MORE), a bunch of mountain bikers eager to spin their wheels in new places. The trail snaked into the distance on either side of Colton Lane, where tents and a podium had been erected for a ribbon cutting. How do you make a path, anyway? Bob Turnbull, the county's natural-surface trail construction manager, explained: Crews tilled the soil and then went over it with a narrow compactor, twice, pounding it hard. The new trail illustrates the power of perseverance. Montgomery County has lagged behind other area jurisdictions in using the wasted space under power lines for recreation.; no_fact;
no_fact; no_fact; She's active in a group called My Muddy Shoes, which celebrates running on dirt. "I got tired of the road," said Bolton, who has run in 24 marathons. A trail is easier on the knees, and the view is usually nicer. Trail running does require that you pay attention, lest you misplace a foot and go flying. "It used to be every time I came out of the woods I'd be holding up one arm, bleeding," Bolton said. "I've gotten better. My feet have gotten intelligent." After the ribbon was cut, Kreslins said Pepco officials assured her that they would push the trail a further 20 feet away from her property line. That meant Turnbull would have to do the only thing harder than making a path: unmaking one. The great escape Whenever I see a high-voltage power line right of way - the wide-open area stretching off into the distance like an inviting road - I'm reminded of my father. That's because he was a U.S. Air Force pilot who flew in the Vietnam War. Before being sent there, he had to attend survival school, where crews are taught what to do if they crash in enemy territory or have to eject.; no_fact;

In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a "dress shirt", a specific type of "collared shirt").

Bill Cosby exits a Pennsylvania courthouse after a mistrial last June in his sexual assault trial. (Eduwardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images) NORRISTOWN, PA. - One woman said the drink Bill Cosby gave her left her feeling like she was "floating." Others said the sips they took at the behest of the legendary comedian made them "woozy" or "fuzzy." There were women who said they felt  "frozen," "lightheaded" or "in a fog," a prosecutor said Monday during a crucial hearing in advance of Cosby's upcoming retrial on sexual assault charges. Each of those women - 19 in all - should be allowed to appear before the jury that will decide Cosby's fate when his retrial begins April 2, argued Montgomery County, Pa., prosecutor Adrienne Jappe. Without them, Jappe said, prosecutors would have a tougher time proving that Cosby was a "predator," a methodical abuser who "systematically engaged in a signature pattern" of drugging and sexually assaulting young women who looked up to him. Prosecutors have tried this approach before. Last year, in advance of a trial that ended with a hung jury, they tried to persuade the judge overseeing the case to allow testimony from 13 previous accusers.; Bill Cosby exits a Pennsylvania courthouse after a mistrial last June in his sexual assault trial.

Chess is believed to have originated in India sometime before the 7th century. The game was derived from the Indian game chaturanga, which is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi, janggi, and shogi. Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.  The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were standardized in the 19th century.;

no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

At that point, Hardaway had 32 points on 12-of-13 shooting and was on pace to shatter Tracy McGrady's record for most points scored against the Wizards (62) in a single game. ESPN gave Washington a 1.7 percent chance to win. (Via ESPN) Bradley Beal made some history With 2:03 remaining in the first half, Bradley Beal knocked down his second three-pointer of the game, giving him 800 for his career. Beal is the first player in NBA history to reach that number before his 25th birthday, though it should be noted that it took Stephen Curry 12 fewer regular season games to make his 1,000th three-pointer.

Bradley Beal on what changed at halftime: "Coach cussed us out." - Hoop District (@HoopDistrictDC) February 15, 2018 Beal helped shut down Hardaway in the second half Beal finished with 36 points, seven assists, five rebounds and three steals, but the defensive effort he led against Hardaway in the second half was every bit as impressive. Hardaway made only 2 of his 10 shots after the break and finished with 37 points. "I told him he wasn't going to score for the rest of the day, and he didn't," Beal told NBC Sports Washington's Chris Miller after the win. "I take more pride in that than the scoring." "They did a good job [on me] coming off screens and their bigs jamming the passing lanes," Hardway told the New York Post.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau, that matches the longest winning streak by a road team at the basketball mecca in NBA history.

Tomas Satoransky did it all With an injured John Wall looking on from the bench, his replacement at point guard had nine points, 11 assists, one turnover, and, perhaps most impressively, three blocks. Satoransky, who returned to the lineup after taking a hard fall and scoring a career-high 25 points in Saturday's win over the Bulls, has stepped up in Wall's absence. Beal's razzle-dazzle dunk Beal will participate in the three-point shootout, not the dunk contest, at this weekend's NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles, but he showed off his creativity and iced the Wizards' win with a nifty bounce pass to himself and slam following a Knicks turnover with a minute to play.

German fans watched their national team lose against South Korea at a public viewing area in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 27. (Omer Messinger/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) Josef Joffe is a member of the editorial council for the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Human beings love to look for signs that prove divine grace or damnation - such as the handwriting on the wall that presaged the demise of Babylon's king Belshazzar 2,500 years ago, as recounted in the Book of Daniel. Closer to home, we have the Curse of the Billy Goat foretelling in 1945: "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more." They didn't triumph in the World Series for 71 long years after that. Fast forward to the World Cup, where four-time winner Germany got wiped out by South Korea in the biggest upset in the tournament's 88-year history. Not by giants such as Brazil or Italy, teams that have won the Cup multiple times. The team's downfall was the South Koreans, who ejected the Germans in the first round. When the mighty falter, there must be a message - like divine intrusion, secular decline or pride that cometh before the fall, just as in the case of the Belshazzar when he was punished for his sins. Listen to the German team's coach, Joachim L?w: "There was perhaps a certain arrogance before the Mexico game" - the first German encounter in the Russia tourney, which the team lost. Now, the cocky German Mannschaft has slunk back home, the butt of condescension and contempt. Naturally, pop philosophers are hawking grandiose theories.; no_fact;

no_fact; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes.

A horror film is a film that seeks to elicit fear. Initially inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has existed as a film genre for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.; A horror film is a film that seeks to elicit fear.

Most have lived in the United States for nearly two decades, and many are here illegally.Even before Trump was elected, more than 1             million returned home, and Aguirre says there is some relief in being away from an increasingly hostile environment. Trump characterized Mexicans as criminals during his campaign and vowed to build a wall at the Mexico&rsquo;s expense.&ldquo;I know that I&rsquo;m in my country. I know that I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; she said in English. &ldquo;I know that if I go outside I don&rsquo;t have to worry about someone coming and taking me away from my family.&rdquo;Trump has fired similar criticisms at the Central American migrants traveling through Mexico toward the United States. But Mexicans along the route would not have it. They showered them with gifts, clothes and food.On Nov. 3 in Isla, as hundreds of migrants crammed into a community center and spilled onto the street, Aguirre&rsquo;s grandmother Martha Ascanio Dominguez ordered Aguirre and her aunts to make them coffee and serve sweet bread and tamales left over from the Day of the Dead.She let a long line of women use her shower and waved a hand at them when they offered to pay.; no_fact;

He has not seen his mother since 1999. His father died in 2007.He and his wife &mdash; who asked not to be identified, for fear of deportation &mdash; worked two jobs for years in the United States. She is 41 and has arthritis. He is 47 and his arms are scarred with long burns from cooking oil.Though migration by Mexicans is declining, they remain the largest group of immigrants in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research organization.;

Carlos Santana, Neil Young and others are floated. Ultimately, the band decides against it and effectively closes shop that winter with a wistful statement saying "the uniquely wonderful beast" known as the Grateful Dead is over. It was more like the beginning of a brief hibernation. Weir deals with the fallout by hitting the road with his band, RatDog, and sticks to blues tunes instead of Dead songs. Kreutzmann flees to Hawaii where he haunts beachside bars and keeps a low profile. Hart branches off and records eclectic percussion albums. Yet the siren song of the Dead keeps calling, along with baby boomer fans and younger devotees who never saw Garcia jam but want to experience the band's sprawling catalogue played on a hot summer night. Selvin, perhaps at times too dryly, observes how a certain darkness lingers in the wake of Garcia's passing. Addiction and health issues hover, and former Dead keyboardist Vince Welnick eventually cuts his own throat. Garcia's widows clash over money and the rights to "Tiger," Garcia's legendary guitar.;

It's this front - understanding the internal politics of bands and Dead World - where Selvin is most comfortable, tracing how versions of the Dead emerge year after year with names like "The Other Ones," "Furthur" and "Phil Lesh and Friends," depending on who's getting along. All the while, Deadheads track each incremental change and new player on stage the same way football fans follow fantasy picks on message boards. Selvin, who had access to the camps of the "core four" but interviewed only two of them, does not take sides as the remaining musicians debate how to handle the empire. Lesh's wife, Jill, is portrayed as the toughest negotiator in the bunch, but she never becomes a villain - just another member of the Dead family trying to figure things out. Even as the "core four" struggles with how to move forward, Selvin also reveals how the band's spirit lives on through a new generation of artists. Phish, Dave Matthews Band and Umphrey's McGee, to name a few, follow the model of grass roots, improvised rock-and-roll as a means of joyful survival in a music industry being upended by downloads and streaming. One of those musical children of the Dead, Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio, joins the "core four" for a triumphant, sold-out return to Soldier Field in 2015. Selvin shines here, capturing the side figures who make their way back to a band and a lifestyle they never really left.; no_fact;

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century and is also regarded as one of the greatest entertainers of all time. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Jackson's 1987 album Bad produced the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles in the nation. He continued to innovate with videos such as "Black or White" and "Scream" throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various genres.;
You'll love the way they move, the quintet of men (and sometimes more) who make up the fractious membership of one of the mightiest of all Motown R&B singing groups in "Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations." The music, of course, is divine, but it's Sergio Trujillo's choreography, full of dazzling splits and hypnotically synchronized unisons, that lifts this jukebox musical above the ordinary. The story itself, though, is exactly what you've come to expect in this increasingly crowded corner of musical theater's answer to Madame Tussauds: the ups and downs and ups and downs, onstage and off, of a platinum-plated pop phenomenon. Truly, it's getting to the point at which visitors from other cultures might think that what we mean by a musical is the downloading to a theater sound system of the greatest hits from the golden age of rock-and-roll. That may be something of an oversimplification - but actually accounts for the rationale behind anthology shows like this, and "Jersey Boys," and "Beautiful: The Carole King Musical," and "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical" and "On Your Feet!" about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, and forthcoming musicals about Cher and Michael Jackson. "Ain't Too Proud," with a book by gifted wordsmith Dominique Morisseau and direction by rock-musical vet Des McAnuff ("The Who's Tommy," among others), had an official Washington opening Thursday night in the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater, after a world premiere in California, and on its way to an inevitable but as yet unannounced Broadway run. On the basis of what's on view in the Eisenhower, the slick and consistently entertaining "Ain't Too Proud" is surely ready for Broadway, and a couple of the anchoring performances infuse it with enough dramatic life to sustain a 2? -hour production. The antagonistic partnership between two of the five "classic" Temptations, Otis Williams (played by Derrick Baskin) and David Ruffin (Ephraim Sykes), sustains the central tension of the piece, with Baskin serving as the evening's even-keeled narrator.; Michael Jackson has a patent.

A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.;

The extremely light hydrogen escaped Venus's gravity, and the oxygen was consumed by rusting into the rocks. Pretty much only the CO2 is left, about 1,500 pounds per square inch of it (compared with 0.006 pounds per square inch of CO2 on the present Earth). Yikes! Tatooine probably never had much water to begin with. As our solar system formed, the early sun blasted the inner planets with radiation and high-speed plasma, which drove off most of the gases (hydrogen, water vapor  and CO2). Earth probably picked up our water from impacts as comets and asteroids rained down on it around 3.8 billion years ago. Maybe Tatooine formed close to its suns, so it got dried out by all that early solar radiation, but it never got re-wetted by a late, heavy bombardment as Earth did. So there you have it: Hoth lost most of its CO2, so it froze solid. If it's still got active volcanoes, there's "a new hope" that over time, the CO2 will build up, since it no longer has rain to remove CO2 by chemical weathering. Tatooine is pretty much out of luck from now on. In contrast to Hoth and Tatooine, the mixture of gases in Earth's atmosphere is just right to support a thriving biosphere and a flourishing human civilization. It would be a good idea to keep it that way! (Climate Central) May the fourth be with you!;

The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.; no_fact;

Instead, spare a moment to admire how many of the movement&rsquo;s leading intellectuals held their ground, even as a substantial portion of the conservative base moved away.Those conservatives opposed Trump early and often &mdash; earlier, in fact, than many liberals. When the Republican nomination was still contested, plenty of left-leaning public intellectuals argued that he was preferable to supposedly more extreme candidates such as Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). In fairness, many of those people later admitted that they&rsquo;d been wrong, although many also implausibly tried to suggest that they&rsquo;d been unaware of Trump&rsquo;s character flaws when they praised him.Many conservatives, by contrast, were consistent throughout. They condemned Trump from the start, and continued to even when it would have been easier to do a sheepish volte-face. They could have offered ample tactical justifications for rallying behind the nominee: Refusing to support Trump meant conceding control of the Supreme Court and the regulatory agencies to left-wing blocs cemented by Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s nominees. On a more personal level, with Trump at the head of the party, denouncing him meant jeopardizing decades of investment in a career as a conservative pundit, politician or policy wonk.Some of the movement&rsquo;s stalwarts did turn into Trump boosters, if only half-hearted ones.; in the first 400 episodes, Homer Simpson has held 188 jobs.; no_fact;

Just please don't expect what we saw last year. JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, Steelers As with Howard, Smith-Schuster didn't let his rookie status prevent him from leading everyone at his position in yards per target (min. 30 targets). His mark of 11.61 was notably better than even that of big-play machine Tyreek Hill (11.27), and it was the ninth-best figure for any WR over the past 10 seasons. As with Kamara, Smith-Schuster should see the ball more this season, but with another talented rookie WR on hand in James Washington and TE Vance McDonald set for a bigger role, it may not be a lot more. There's still reason to be excited, but reasonable expectations of regression tell us to temper it just a tad.

There may not be as many touchdown celebrations for Deshaun Watson in 2018. (Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images) There are a few rules to live by in fantasy football, such as, never take a kicker before the final round. Here's another important rule: Don't assume that whatever happened last year will happen again this year. One of the challenges in fantasy football is that the real-life sport on which it's based equates to a minefield of small sample sizes. Even an entire season consists of just 16 games - less than a fifth of what NBA and NHL players are given to prove their worth, never mind baseball's marathon slog - and, of course, injuries limit many players to fewer than that, not to mention the annual Week 17 second-string wackiness. [Four fantasy football draft picks to avoid and four to pounce on] With that in mind, here are a few players whose 2017 performances are unlikely to be replicated, particularly in the often fickle area of touchdowns. In these four cases, former studs may appear somewhat less studly than they did in 2017. On Friday, we'll look at four players who performed below their averages in 2017 that may have better seasons ahead in 2018.; no_fact;

The Fake News stories were just the opposite - Disgraceful!" Not a single word about the victims. Not even a word about the grieving city, except in the context of how Trump and the first lady were received, and how the trip was covered by the news media. What kind of president can visit the site of such a devastating tragedy and come away thinking only of himself? What kind of person is so monumentally self-centered? We don't expect our political leaders to be paragons of virtue. But we need them, at the very least, to be capable of feeling empathy and shame. Trump's supreme egotism and utter shamelessness differentiate him from all previous presidents. They allow him to deliberately divide the country by playing to white-nationalist anxieties. They allow him to warp both foreign and domestic policy for short-term political gain - and to do so transparently, without the tiniest fig leaf of pretense. They allow him not to care what damage he has wrought, so long as he gets favorable coverage on the cable news shows he watches constantly instead of doing actual work. Now he is threatening to void the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship by decree, which he cannot possibly do, and to send thousands of troops to the border with Mexico for no reason at all - except, he hopes, to inflame the anti-immigrant spirits of his loyal base.;

Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment.

He is one of the most acclaimed rappers of all time.Born and raised in New York City, Jay-Z began his musical career in the mid 1990s, after which he released his debut studio album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996, to widespread critical and commercial success. He released the album a year after founding the record label Roc-A-Fella Records. His subsequent albums have also seen great praise, with The Blueprint (2001) and The Black Album (2003) later being heralded as modern musical classics. He followed these with the collaborative album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, his critically lauded thirteenth studio album 4:44 (2017), and a collaborative effort titled Everything Is Love with wife Beyoncé in 2018.; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

Typical advice: Start saving for retirement right away. The reality: Millennials' money is often too tight, and for the many who have student loans, they may be best served spending the first few years out of college aggressively paying off this debt. I have one caveat. If their employer offers a retirement match, I tell young adults to at least invest enough to get that free money. But otherwise, concentrate on getting rid of debt first. If they pay off the loans fast enough, they will still have a significant running start in saving for retirement. Typical advice: Only live at home if you have student loans to repay. The reality: The share of college graduates in their 20s who lived with their parents increased from 19 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2016, according to a survey by Zillow, a real estate information website. With the high cost of housing in many markets, why in the world are we telling folks they are a financial failure for living with their parents? Whether you have debt or not, taking a few years to save up some money is a financially sound way to launch.;

no_fact; Older adults love to smugly talk about the "entitled" attitude of millennials. But today's youth actually have a lot in common with both the Depression-era generation and baby boomers: Sixty-two percent of millennials identify themselves as savers, and 80 percent say they budget their money, according to a TD Ameritrade survey. Millennials are not fans of debt either. Nearly half of them say they feel anxious about being in debt, and three in 10 report being embarrassed, frustrated or regretful for having borrowed in the first place. Unlike past generations, young adults have unprecedented financial pressure. They often start off their adulthood in deep student-loan debt, and they also face relentless influences we older adults did not have. It used to be that you were not bombarded with marketing messages until after you got home and turned on the television. Now the device delivering the enticements to buy, buy, buy is right there - all the time - in your pocket or purse. Celebrities constantly chronicle their brand-name lives on Instagram, and our friends on Facebook celebrate their fabulous vacations in real time. We need to give millennials a break.

With this accountability, you will not be robbing them of their journey to independence. What's irresponsible is renting when it means you cannot aggressively get rid of student loans or save for emergencies and retirement. I encourage parents not just to allow their graduates to come back home to live, but to encourage it. If they are not in debt, they should save most of their paychecks to build a significant savings cushion. Then they can move out. For graduates with student loans, I advise taking all of their paychecks - minus some money for personal expenses - to aggressively get rid of the debt. Do this for two or even three years and the debt is gone. Typical advice: If you do not have one already, get a credit card to learn how to manage money and build up a good credit history.;
no_fact; The reality: I concede that credit matters. But it also can be a dangerous tool for people just starting out. It is too easy to live above their limited means.

All they really have to do is buy something for $10 or $20 and pay off the balance in full and on time. Repeat this for about six months, and then stop using the card. That is all it takes to establish that they are responsible borrowers. Millennials have a lot of financial pressure.

And we have left quite a fiscal mess for them - a gargantuan federal deficit, a pending Social Security shortfall and a health-care system that makes many people one major illness away from bankruptcy. When giving graduates advice, let's cut them some slack and allow them a chance to get their financial footing before kicking them out into the world.;
no_fact; Done correctly, shared housing is the prudent thing to do. Make sure they are saving or paying down the debt. With this accountability, you will not be robbing them of their journey to independence. What's irresponsible is renting when it means you cannot aggressively get rid of student loans or save for emergencies and retirement. I encourage parents not just to allow their graduates to come back home to live, but to encourage it. If they are not in debt, they should save most of their paychecks to build a significant savings cushion. Then they can move out. For graduates with student loans, I advise taking all of their paychecks - minus some money for personal expenses - to aggressively get rid of the debt. Do this for two or even three years and the debt is gone. Typical advice: If you do not have one already, get a credit card to learn how to manage money and build up a good credit history.; The reality: I concede that credit matters. But it also can be a dangerous tool for people just starting out. It is too easy to live above their limited means. The advice about the need to establish credit gets twisted into the notion that young adults have to constantly use it to get and keep a high credit score. All they really have to do is buy something for $10 or $20 and pay off the balance in full and on time. Repeat this for about six months, and then stop using the card.

no_fact; So, within the context of what they are dealing with, here is where I think some experts go wrong in providing advice to college graduates. Typical advice: Start saving for retirement right away. The reality: Millennials' money is often too tight, and for the many who have student loans, they may be best served spending the first few years out of college aggressively paying off this debt. I have one caveat. If their employer offers a retirement match, I tell young adults to at least invest enough to get that free money. But otherwise, concentrate on getting rid of debt first. If they pay off the loans fast enough, they will still have a significant running start in saving for retirement. Typical advice: Only live at home if you have student loans to repay. The reality: The share of college graduates in their 20s who lived with their parents increased from 19 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2016, according to a survey by Zillow, a real estate information website. With the high cost of housing in many markets, why in the world are we telling folks they are a financial failure for living with their parents? Whether you have debt or not, taking a few years to save up some money is a financially sound way to launch.; no_fact;

A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot while the wearer is doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing.;

While the spatial size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe.The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.;

With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best-selling book of all time.Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.;

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.;

no_fact; There is a deep-water fish called the Black Swallower (or great swallower) that can swallow whole fish twice its length and up to ten times it mass.; Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.;

Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago;
no_fact; Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo. Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago. Nonetheless, in November 2018, scientists reported that nearly all extant populations of animals, including humans, may be a result of a population expansion that began between one and two hundred thousand years ago, based on genetic mitochondrial DNA studies. As such, humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.The spread of humans and their large and increasing population has had a profound impact on large areas of the environment and millions of native species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, and are the only extant species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.; no_fact;

"Mudbound" director Dee Rees, though not recognized in that category, became the first black woman in 45 years - and the second ever - to be nominated for a screenplay Oscar. The first was "Lady Sings the Blues" by writer Suzanne de Passe, who shared the 1973 nomination with co-writers Chris Clark and Terence McCloy. Following sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey, Christopher Plummer stepped into the role of J. Paul Getty in "All the Money in the World" and shot his scenes in just 10 days. The performance earned him a supporting actor nod, and at 88, Plummer is now the oldest actor to ever be nominated. ("Titanic" actress Gloria Stuart was 87, when she was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar in 1998.)

no_fact; Maybe mine was yelling, "Hey, lady, you need a shorter commute!" But I suspect it is simply this: We feel guilty as working moms because we are put in a no-win situation. Too many companies and too many managers still hold it against us if we openly parent. It's like: "Take a morning off but don't tell me it's because you're going to another holiday concert at school." (Two kids = two concerts - oh, never mind.) So we slip in and slip out of our two worlds, moving in our own Pigpen-like smog of anxiety, terrified that our secret life of parenting will be exposed. Guilt is a funny thing. We apply it inconsistently, without much logic. Years ago, when my children were very young, I was beating myself up for even considering leaving a job that let me work at home, for an in-office position that piqued my interest and paid more. A great mentor and friend said, "Don't ever feel guilty for providing for your family." Providing, I see now, could be making money, or driving kids to 17 activities. It's the stuff that takes you away from being this mythical, Pinterest-perfect Super Mom and makes you an actual, real-world super mom. I leave you with that, and I leave myself with that, too.

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

"I'm skipping the parent coffee," a friend confided on the first day of elementary school. "I can't take the pressure to sign up for this committee and that." She went on to tell me that in the part of Europe where she had lived, parents were expected not to communicate with the school at all. I felt immensely grateful for this information, tucking it away in the dark web of my brain to replay when I was back at work and torturing myself. Another friend informed me that she bagged middle-school Back to School Night. It wasn't convenient and she was there last year for her older son, so she didn't go. Just like that. I didn't go to the grade-school coffee either. I could tell you that I'm parenting like a European, but honestly, I don't like meetings. You know what, it may be healthier for our children to have some space. Isn't the goal of this parenting thing to raise kids who feel secure when we're there on the sidelines - and secure when we can't be? As for dinner hour, pizza is still in the rotation (some weeks, ahem, more than once). I did work haricot verts onto our plates, but do you think my kids ate them? And my house doesn't look like I imagined it would if only I were at home with time to declutter. Although I have attacked old mail like nobody's business.

Instead of thinking: I cranked through work to leave early for my two-train, hour-and-a-half commute home, I thought, I blew it again. Then, post-layoff, a funny thing happened. I got to Henry's travel baseball game on time. I parked my spectator chair, ready to chat. The game started. Where were the other parents? Slowly, a couple trickled in. Some had dropped their kids (and their chairs) off early and took off for a few innings. By the fifth inning (out of a seven-inning game), there was a throng of us. But right when the game started? Nope, two other parents and me. Back when I would rush to arrive late, I saw a crowd and concluded that everyone else had been there for the whole game.

(iStock) This June, I was laid off from my job in media. Don't feel too bad for me. I got a nice package after almost 10 years at a large company, and it was early summer. In truth, it was kind of a dream. (Well, except for the 3 a.m. "What if we can't pay our mortgage?" panic attacks.) And it meant, I thought, that I would have a few months to be completely there for my two sons (ages 14 and 10). We would cut back on takeout and have more home-cooked meals with a green vegetable other than guacamole. I would make it on time to all their travel sports. I could be class mom! You're probably already laughing at my naivet?. But I imagined that in the baseball game of parenting, everyone else was batting 1,000 and I was scraping by at .150. I know I'm a loving mom, don't get me wrong. And I realize other people are human, too. But I was so wrapped up in my guilt that I kept forgetting that no parent is there for every single thing. Okay, that one mom is, but she clearly has boundary issues. Still, I felt like a bad mom almost every day. If I took one train later than usual at night - bad mom!; no_fact;

in 1972, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in Pompeii...with no audience.; A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience. The performance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, choir, or band. Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls, arenas and parks to large multipurpose buildings, and even sports stadiums. Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts. Informal names for a concert include show and gig.;

no_fact; Maybe mine was yelling, "Hey, lady, you need a shorter commute!" But I suspect it is simply this: We feel guilty as working moms because we are put in a no-win situation. Too many companies and too many managers still hold it against us if we openly parent. It's like: "Take a morning off but don't tell me it's because you're going to another holiday concert at school." (Two kids = two concerts - oh, never mind.) So we slip in and slip out of our two worlds, moving in our own Pigpen-like smog of anxiety, terrified that our secret life of parenting will be exposed. Guilt is a funny thing. We apply it inconsistently, without much logic. Years ago, when my children were very young, I was beating myself up for even considering leaving a job that let me work at home, for an in-office position that piqued my interest and paid more. A great mentor and friend said, "Don't ever feel guilty for providing for your family." Providing, I see now, could be making money, or driving kids to 17 activities. It's the stuff that takes you away from being this mythical, Pinterest-perfect Super Mom and makes you an actual, real-world super mom. I leave you with that, and I leave myself with that, too.

Ever since "American Idol," country music fans have enthusiastically voted on reality singing competitions. "The Voice" is often criticized for not being able to produce stars, but the country acts who have won - Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sundance Head - typically fare better than winners from other genres. At a recent country radio conference in Nashville, when asked why country contestants do so well on "The Voice," the Swon Brothers (who landed in third place in Season 4) responded simply "Blake Shelton." "We got his phone number, we have stayed at his house, we have hunted at his house. There's a personal connection, he goes above and beyond," Colton Swon said. "He's been like a big brother." "And he had our back when things got a little tricky," added his brother, Zach. The Swon Brothers got a record deal after "The Voice," though were later dropped, and are now releasing music independently.

Country music, also known as  country and western (or simply country), and hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk and Western music) and blues.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.According to Lindsey Starnes, the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.;

no_fact; no_fact; Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.;

Our classical music, our classic theater, our Old Master artworks are presented in such halos of sanctity that it&rsquo;s hard to apprehend them as the moving, vital things they are. Those of us who are used to the trappings tend to forget the artifice &mdash; until someone rips off the mummy&rsquo;s bindings and presents the bloody immediate reality this art had when it was new: when it was provocative, unfamiliar, something you might not like. Timothy Nelson, the new artistic director of the In Series, managed to do this with his company debut, &ldquo;Viva V.E. R. D. I.: The Promised End,&rdquo; directed by Steven Scott Mazzola, which opened a two-week run at the Source Theatre on Saturday night. Mind you, some people might hate this piece. Indeed, when I describe it, it sounds like parody. It features an actress playing Giuseppe Verdi and King Lear (both at the same time) in a monologue Nelson created by combining excerpts of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play and other sources. All this is juxtaposed with a complete performance of the Verdi Requiem with a pianist and eight singers in period costume from 1901 (the year of Verdi&rsquo;s death), who enact the music as they sing, taking on not so much characters as human emotions.; no_fact;
no_fact; no_fact; The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. ; The music often drowns out the actress, and sometimes vice versa. I went in armed with both hope and skepticism. I was mightily interested to see what Nelson, who used to run the intriguing American Opera Theater in Baltimore, would bring to the In Series, which has for almost four decades been a labor of love for its now-retired founder, Carla H&uuml;bner. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure how well the collage treatment would do by either Verdi or Shakespeare. What I saw proved less avant-garde or experimental than I expected: The music was not &ldquo;collaged&rdquo; at all (apart from one iteration of &ldquo;Va pensiero,&rdquo; the chorus from &ldquo;Nabucco,&rdquo; sung at the beginning, before the Requiem started). But what I really wasn&rsquo;t prepared for was the visceral impact it had on me to sit in a small space and have this powerful, beloved music in my face, enacted by people who were mining both the dramatic and musical meaning of each line, resulting in an emotional directness that bypassed reason or analysis. It did remind me of two other experiences: the times the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra played Debussy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Afternoon of a Faun&rdquo; and Copland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Appalachian Spring&rdquo; from memory, moving around the stage as they performed. Here as there, a raw nerve of music was exposed and laid directly on my own nerves, and I found myself fighting tears without being able to say entirely why. [Choreographer Liz Lerman brings UMD orchestra to its feet]I hate even to go into critic-speak about which of the singers were better or worse, because I ended up loving them all for different reasons (especially the four women, sopranos Teresa Ferrara and Natalie Conte and mezzos Anamer Castrello and Elizabeth Mondragon), and because the point was about something so much more important than whether I or anyone else was going to analyze musical perfection or play &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; over an occasional slip.; no_fact;

His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.;

no_fact; Certainly the opening-night audience greeted the performers with the enthusiasm they deserved. Art is naive. There&rsquo;s something painfully innocent about the attempt to forge a meaningful statement out of nothing; to stand up in front of people and sing or play or speak with all your heart, knowing you may look foolish, knowing you may spectacularly fail. Our big institutions, the mighty choruses and orchestras and theaters that offer Verdi Requiems and King Lears, generally insulate us and themselves from this kind of failure: At the very least, they are offering established masterpieces, works that are beyond criticism. It&rsquo;s not easy to put these works back in the hands of individuals and allow them a new hearing, with all the vulnerability and risk involved. This piece, to me, did that, and said something significant about art in the process. Whatever you think of it, it signals a significant new presence on the D.C. scene, and I am eager to see what else this enterprising little company has to offer. &ldquo;Viva V.E. R. D.

Side One of Tape One would start slow and mellow - guest-arrival music - then build in tempo and intensity until somewhere around Tape Three the bacchanalia soundtrack kicked in.

I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna ask me now what I think of Chumbawamba or Superchunk. Then there were the cassette tapes. People make fun of that obsolete technology today, but there was a time when it was cutting edge. Or cutting middle, anyway. The cassette tape was the birth control pill of personal audio, symbolizing freedom and choice: Listen to it in your home, on your person, in your car! And when it got tangled and mangled in the tape deck of your Toyota Tercel, roll down the window and chuck it out, holding a bit of the brown ribbon between your fingers as you let it unspool in the slipstream. So, I have a fondness for cassettes. But even I had to admit that a TDK dub of Marshall Crenshaw's debut album was surplus when I also had it on vinyl and CD (and iTunes). Out it went.

But even if I binge-listened to all of it, it would only provide me with a grounding of alternative music of the mid-1990s. I'm pretty sure nobody's gonna ask me now what I think of Chumbawamba or Superchunk. Then there were the cassette tapes. People make fun of that obsolete technology today, but there was a time when it was cutting edge. Or cutting middle, anyway. The cassette tape was the birth control pill of personal audio, symbolizing freedom and choice: Listen to it in your home, on your person, in your car! And when it got tangled and mangled in the tape deck of your Toyota Tercel, roll down the window and chuck it out, holding a bit of the brown ribbon between your fingers as you let it unspool in the slipstream. So, I have a fondness for cassettes. But even I had to admit that a TDK dub of Marshall Crenshaw's debut album was surplus when I also had it on vinyl and CD (and iTunes). Out it went. But what do you do with a mix tape? Those musical scrapbooks expressed real personality. They also represented real toil.;

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

no_fact; By the early 20th century, Somali-speaking nomads established themselves in what is now northeastern Kenya. Still, when you read about Kenyan Somalis in major media outlets, they are portrayed as "others" or as strangers in stories about terrorism or refugees. How can Somalis be both citizens and strangers in Kenya? A new book seeks to answer that question by tracking the history of being Somali in Kenya. This week's installment of the African Politics Summer Reading Spectacular is about historian Keren Weitzberg's book "We Do Not Have Borders: Greater Somalia and the Predicaments of Belonging in Kenya." Weitzberg draws on a range of sources for her study, including documents from colonial and governmental archives, newspaper articles, human rights reports, and also oral histories, memoirs and poetry. Particularly refreshing was how Weitzberg challenges scholarly conventions by using oral poetry to offer insights into how "rank-and-file nomadic people" see and shape their identity as Somalis.;
no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; Residents of Eastleigh, a Nairobi neighborhood known for its densely Somali population, on Jan. 18, 2010. (Simon Maina/AFP via Getty Images) Pirates. Terrorists. Refugees. There is a long history of negative portrayals of Somalis around the world. Consider, for example, Kenyan Somalis. According to the most recent census, there are 2.4 million Somalis in Kenya (out of an overall population of 38.6 million in the country). Somalis have lived in Kenya since before colonial rule.; There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards is inspiring.;
Weitzberg characterizes this oral poetry and public shaming as "a powerful tool of dissent." Perhaps of greatest interest to our readers is chapter 7 in Weitzberg's book, which focuses on what it means to be Somali in Kenya today. "Somaliness" is reexamined in light of al-Shabab terrorist attacks on Nairobi's Westgate Mall in Nairobi in 2010 and on Garissa University (in northeastern Kenya) in 2015, and the subsequent treatment of Kenyan Somalis in the wake of those attacks. (Of course, the earlier chapters provide the necessary broader, historical context to understanding the contemporary period.) While Weitzberg's book does solid work in its analysis of "Somaliness" in Kenya, it does much more than that. Her examination of Kenyan Somali identity urges us to reflect on what we think we know about citizenship and belonging more broadly. Her work is a much-needed contribution in this contemporary moment, when people in corridors of power are deciding who is a foreigner and who has rights to move freely in this world.;

Kimberly Noel Kardashian West (; born October 21, 1980) is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur and socialite. Kardashian first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after a 2003 sex tape with her former boyfriend Ray J was leaked in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success soon led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. Kardashian's personal life soon became subject to widespread media attention.In recent years, Kardashian has grown an influential online and social media presence, including tens of millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram. She has released a variety of products tied to her name, including the successful 2014 mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a variety of clothing and products, and the 2015 photo book Selfish. Her relationship with rapper Kanye West has also received significant media coverage; the couple married in 2014 and they have three children together.Time magazine included Kardashian on their list of 2015's 100 most influential people, while Vogue described her in 2016 as a "pop culture phenomenon."

And while they trust the coach, known for his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense, they adore Brady. "Brady is a kind of messiah figure for a lot of Patriots fans," Beneke said. "It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.;
"I do want to know the whys in life," Brady said in a version of the spiritual episode, according to the New York Times. "I do want to know why we're here, where we're going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me." [In a tough sports town, baptisms and Bible studies fuel many of the Eagles' stars] For Chopra, son of best-selling spiritual writer Deepak Chopra and a devoted Boston sports fan, seeing sports as a religion makes sense. Both create community, have saints and rituals, and take place on hallowed ground. And - in a polarized nation - both can unite disparate groups of people, at least for a few hours. Sports might bring people together better than religion, said Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. "It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds," Wann said. "I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom." The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed: "In Bill We Trust," a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase "Do your job." Fans have bought in with near-religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. People invest a lot of hope in the team, Beneke said.; no_fact;

When asked about any physical threats against porn star Stormy Daniels, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said they "condemn anyone threatening any individual." (Reuters) Stormy Daniels's attorney has been all over TV and radio in recent weeks, saying the porn star should be free to discuss her alleged affair with President Trump because Trump neglected to sign their 2016 nondisclosure agreement. "Mr. Trump never signed the agreement, and, therefore, there never was a formal agreement, and the agreement is null and void," Michael Avenatti said on NPR last week. This contention is central to a lawsuit in which Daniels has asked a court to invalidate the contract - and it is probably a losing argument, according to legal experts. "The idea that it's null and void, I don't think that goes anywhere," said Charles Fried, a former U.S. solicitor general who teaches contract law at Harvard Law School. "The contract was performed," added Omri Ben-Shahar, a contract-law specialist at the University of Chicago Law School. "Stormy Daniels got paid and took the money, so how can she say that there was no binding contract until signature?"; no_fact;
Daniels accepted $130,000 shortly before Election Day 2016 in exchange for her promise not to talk publicly about what she claims was a sexual relationship with Trump a decade earlier. The president denies the affair. Daniels has offered to return the money but has treated the nondisclosure agreement as nonbinding in the meantime, taping an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" that is tentatively scheduled to air on Sunday. The contract, which refers to Trump and Daniels by the pseudonyms David Dennison and Peggy Peterson, does say that "this agreement, when signed by all Parties, is a valid and binding agreement" and that "by their signatures below, the parties each have approved and executed this agreement." Daniels signed her real name, Stephanie Clifford, on the line marked "PP"; the line for "DD" is blank. However, Trump attorney Michael Cohen signed on behalf of Essential Consultants ("EC"), a limited-liability corporation created to represent Trump's interests. "Even if the parties did understand that a signature was the required means to manifest their assent, DD can argue that EC was acting as DD's agent and that DD was bound by EC's signature," said Anne Fleming, a contract-law expert at the Georgetown University Law Center.;

no_fact; There is a possible wrinkle. Daniels's lawsuit alleges that "Mr. Trump purposely did not sign the agreement so he could later, if need be, publicly disavow any knowledge of the hush agreement." That argument makes sense to George M. Cohen (no relation to Trump's lawyer), who teaches contract law at the University of Virginia School of Law. "It's possible that DD declined to sign to preserve deniability later on while [also] preserving the ability to enforce against PP," said Cohen, adding that Trump might have been "trying to have his cake and eat it." "A court might view that intention as insufficient to create an enforceable contract, on the theory that you have to make a choice to be in the contract, with obligations binding on you, as well, or not," Cohen said. If not because of Trump's missing signature, Daniels still might succeed in her petition to void the contract, for a different reason. "Courts can refuse to enforce contracts for lots of reasons," said David Hoffman, a contract-law specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.; the U.S. President's Guest House is larger than the White House;

An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).To elect means "to choose or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.; Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio.; no_fact;

no_fact; "I do want to know the whys in life," Brady said in a version of the spiritual episode, according to the New York Times. "I do want to know why we're here, where we're going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me." [In a tough sports town, baptisms and Bible studies fuel many of the Eagles' stars] For Chopra, son of best-selling spiritual writer Deepak Chopra and a devoted Boston sports fan, seeing sports as a religion makes sense. Both create community, have saints and rituals, and take place on hallowed ground. And - in a polarized nation - both can unite disparate groups of people, at least for a few hours. Sports might bring people together better than religion, said Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. "It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds," Wann said. "I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom." The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed: "In Bill We Trust," a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase "Do your job." Fans have bought in with near-religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass.

And just like a preacher who wants to share good news, McDaniel said, "Brady wants to let as many people as possible know about what he believes." Bob Ryan, a longtime-but-now-retired columnist for the Boston Globe, is more skeptical. He's fine with the on-field success. And promoting good nutrition and fitness is fine, as is having spiritual beliefs. But spare him the idea of Brady as a spiritual figure. "He's trying to sell us a bill of goods," Ryan said. "It's cultlike. The book, to me, is creepy. And it looks like that's going to be his life after football." As for Brady, he appears focused on the big game. And he shows no signs of quitting. "So if you're going to compete against me, you better be willing to give up your life," Brady says in the first episode of "Tom vs. Time." "Because I'm giving up mine."; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.; no_fact;

Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

no_fact; Country music, also known as  country and western (or simply country), and hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk and Western music) and blues.Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.According to Lindsey Starnes, the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.;

Meanwhile, cable television has siphoned off millions of people who used to watch the broadcast networks; the viewership of network evening news programs has fallen by half since 1980. That may not matter too much if you happen to live in one of those urban bubbles. My local paper had excellent coverage of the outage, including a handy map. But if you're a thousand miles away from The Washington Post or the New York Times, there may soon be no one to tell you what's happening in your community. This has been remarked upon before. But the focus is usually on the shrinking bubble from which our news emanates, or else on what local politics may look like when there's no one to dutifully report what was said at the latest school board meeting. Less attention is given to simple questions such as how people are going to find out about local emergencies when the nearest reporter is half a continent away. Social media can probably pick up some of the slack. But not necessarily as much as you might think. Yes, I found out about the water warning from Twitter, but I live in the very media bubble that is not reporting on the city council meetings of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Tuscaloosa, Ala.; no_fact;

Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s.A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals.; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; no_fact; Following the death Monday of Paul Allen, the billionaire co-creator of Microsoft, from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, questions have been raised about the futures of the two sports franchises he owned - the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks. While a succession plan appears to be in place in Seattle, the Blazers' situation is less clear. Allen bought the basketball team for $70 million in 1988 and became one of the NBA's most influential owners. Despite the smaller market, Allen was willing to use his tremendous wealth to spend generously, leading to several good teams: the Clyde Drexler-led squads that began his tenure, reaching the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992; the one led by Rasheed Wallace and Scottie Pippen that took Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2000 Western Conference finals; the Brandon Roy-LaMarcus Aldridge-Greg Oden core that was derailed by injuries to Roy and Oden; and the latest iteration, which initially featured Aldridge but has shifted to Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. What happens next for the franchise? Allen is the second NBA owner to die in 2018, following New Orleans Pelicans steward Tom Benson in March. Unlike that situation, though - when Benson's wife, Gayle, immediately took control of the franchise and indicated she wanted things to remain that way - the future in Portland is more up in the air.;

Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; the phenomena also includes supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which is the study of the Universe as a whole.Astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas, performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.;
(Scott Tilley) "They'd given up looking for it, and I happened to stumble across it," he said. Tilley traces his interest in space back to a "60 Minutes" special he saw when he was a kid. His father was an amateur radio operator, so he was able to use his father's equipment found around the house to tinker and explore. He said his love of space is not fueled by the goal of discovering satellites or other man-made objects. He loves exploration for the journey. It is not so bad to find something important that had once eluded brilliant scientists. "You feel like you've contributed something of value to science," he said. [NASA lost contact with a satellite 12 years ago. An amateur just found its signal.] Caption information below the photo of Tilley's camera has been updated. He did not, as it previously indicated, use the camera to track IMAGE.;
Scott Tilley, pictured near his home in Canada, found a NASA satellite that had been lost for more than a decade. (Courtesy of Scott Tilley) Amateur astronomer Scott Tilley was in his home office on a recent evening, using his radio equipment to scan space in a needle-in-a-haystack search for a spy satellite operated by the U.S. Air Force. Tilley, 47, launches himself on missions like this nightly. Since he was about 8, he has been a devoted but earthbound space explorer, looking for hidden satellites in the sky for hours on end. As he scanned the skies that night a few weeks ago, he did not find what he was looking for, but he came across something possibly even better: a different satellite, a weather craft NASA lost more than a decade ago. NASA had searched for the spacecraft, worth about $150 million, for two years before giving up. For an amateur astronomer, it was the stuff of dreams. "By far, it's the most important thing I've discovered," said Tilley, an electrical engineer. "It's a pretty cool thing in my world." Tilley, who lives in British Columbia, had single-handedly located the weather-tracking spacecraft IMAGE, which NASA launched in 2000 and lost contact with five years later. The IMAGE satellite undergoes launch preparations in early 2000. (NASA) At dinner, he told his wife about his discovery.;

Then he ran his thumb across his throat. And laughed.Later, Acosta described &ldquo;the Trump effect.&rdquo;&ldquo;It has normalized and sanitized nastiness and cruelty in a way that I just never thought I would see,&rdquo; he said, shortly after that Montana rally.The Trump effect is a straight line from years of his hateful rhetoric to real-world danger. It&rsquo;s a line that goes directly from disrespect to pipe bomb.And &mdash; almost inevitably &mdash; it will eventually go from failed attempt to spilled blood.If you can&rsquo;t see it, you aren&rsquo;t looking.But on Wednesday, plenty of people weren&rsquo;t looking. The news reports of bombs sent to the most frequent objects of President Trump&rsquo;s sustained criticism brought a torrent of nonsense.

"Each had a specific, different theory that resonated personally with them," he wrote. "As is, the movie lets them all find a meaningful and bespoke connection. Clarity would have disappointed at least 3 of them." Many reactions on social media shared the positive sentiment. Actress Hari Nef praised the writing and visuals - calling it "vast surreal beautiful dramatically whole and deeply unsettling" - while others such as BuzzFeed News's Anne Helen Petersen praised the female-dominated cast: "The best part of Annihilation is the part when 90% of the dialogue is spoken by women and 95% of the action is performed by women." Though "Annihilation" has been distributed to American theaters, Paramount sold the international rights to Netflix in December. Fans of the film criticized the studio for this decision, arguing that it deprives those outside of the United States of the proper viewing experience. Whether to hear the weird musical cue boom or to see the swamp's psychedelic beauty on the big screen, the film is meant to be seen in a theater.;

That would be my ultimate fantasy dinner.

[Marijuana recall: ForwardGro products ordered off the shelves] The federal prohibition on buying and selling marijuana puts radio and television ads out of reach, which is why sellers rely on social media to boost their brand. But Facebook and Instagram don't allow the promotion of marijuana sales regardless of state or country. That means no advertising discounts or listing prices, nor mentioning there is product for sale. The platforms prohibit marijuana dispensaries from providing their phone numbers or street addresses.

no_fact; no_fact; With the NFC East up for grabs, the Dallas Cowboys signaled Monday that they are in win-now mode by agreeing to trade next year&rsquo;s first-round draft pick to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Amari Cooper.The deal gives the Cowboys the potential No. 1 wideout that they so desperately need after parting ways during the offseason with Dez Bryant. They can hope that the trade will jump-start an offense that hasn&rsquo;t had enough options in the passing game when opposing defenses manage to shut down tailback Ezekiel Elliott, as during Sunday&rsquo;s narrow loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field.But will this be enough to vault the Cowboys into the NFC playoffs? That&rsquo;s debatable.Cooper is a fourth-year player who was a Pro Bowl selection in each of his first two NFL seasons. He looked like one of the league&rsquo;s next great receivers when he totaled 155 catches for 2,223 yards and 11 touchdowns during that stretch. But he has struggled since then, with a modest 70 catches for 960 yards and eight touchdowns in 20 games since the start of last season. He has been plagued by injuries and drops.Now he has a new home, thanks to the Raiders&rsquo; rebuilding project and the Cowboys&rsquo; hope for a turnaround. The Raiders traded Cooper after dealing star pass rusher Khalil Mack, the former NFL defensive player of the year, to the Chicago Bears before the season. They have stockpiled three first-round picks in next year&rsquo;s draft while basically giving up on the present as Coach Jon Gruden has led them to a 1-5 mark in his return to coaching.As for the Cowboys, Sunday&rsquo;s 20-17 loss at the Redskins dropped them to 3-4, tied with the Philadelphia Eagles for second in the NFC East.; no_fact;

We need to figure that out as an offense, and we&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;The trade makes sense in the bigger picture for the Cowboys. Cooper, 24, is still young, and he is under contract through next season after the Raiders exercised the fifth-year option in his rookie deal. The draft is, at best, a 50-50 proposition. It is perhaps even less certain than that when you&rsquo;re selecting a wide receiver in the opening round.

no_fact; A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.;

The president is a common title for the head of state in most republics. In politics, president is a title given to leaders of republican states.The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government. In parliamentary republics, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In presidential and semi-presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the head of government. In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one-party state may also be called a president.; fantasy congress exist, where players draft members of congress and points were based off Legislative success.;

Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling stock to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements that appear onscreen.; no_fact; no_fact;

The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.; no_fact;
Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.; no_fact;

"It would be hard to describe Belichick that way. He doesn't exude any of the qualities that we typically associate with charismatic figures." Beneke worries that devotion to the Patriots can overshadow other kinds of faith. During the football season, Sundays in New England often are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team, even in church, he said. [The best of Super Bowl LII: Gronkowski good to go for Sunday; Trump passes on traditional interview] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God, rather than the team. The Patriots have a number of spiritual players, including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater, known for his off-field evangelism. Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday, a national church-based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday. Rick McDaniel, a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, Va., says there are faith lessons in Brady's example - even if you don't buy his TB12 Method. Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds, McDaniel said. Brady began his career as a sixth-round draft pick and now is arguably the best ever at his craft. And he's shown the ability to rebound from adversity: Last year, the Patriots were down 28 to 3 in the Super Bowl before coming back to win in overtime. "He is a great example of what can happen if you are radically committed," McDaniel said. McDaniel believes Brady's commitment to the TB12 Method is sincere.;

INDIANAPOLIS - President Trump on Saturday strongly condemned the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue as "pure evil" and anti-Semitic, and then, without skipping a beat, slipped into campaign mode with attacks on trade deals, a discourse on palm trees and a dig at a potential 2020 rival. Just over a week before midterm elections, the president traveled to Indiana for a convention speech and later a political rally in Illinois, though he joked about canceling both events because of a "bad hair day." "This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable, our nation and the world are shocked," Trump told the audience at the National FFA Organization event, adding that the "vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism" must be rejected, as should all prejudice. The president said that the shooting that left at least 11 dead and six wounded occurred at a baby-naming ceremony, which happens when an infant is eight days old. It was the second time in less than a week that a horrific act shocked the nation - law enforcement arrested and charged a Florida man with sending mail bombs to prominent Democrats on Friday - and Americans awaited the president's words of comfort and reassurance. President Trump said the crime scene near the Oct. 27 shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue is 'one of the worst' that professionals have seen. (The Washington Post) Upon arriving in Murphysboro, Ill., Trump said he would travel to Pittsburgh, though he did not offer specifics on timing. He also defended his campaign schedule, saying, "we cannot let our schedule or our lives change." His appearance came on behalf of Rep.

Trump also suggested that he should have skipped his trip because his hair looked bad after speaking to reporters in the rain at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland about the shooting. "The wind was blowing and the rain, and I was soaking wet, and that's what I ended up with today," Trump said. "And I said maybe I should cancel this arrangement because I have a bad hair day." Trump then talked about the robustness of the American military, recovery for Southern farmers whose crops were destroyed by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and Jimmy Carter.

The African penguins at the Maryland Zoo. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) On a recent Monday afternoon, I was crouching on the floor of the Maryland Zoo, carefully stroking the feathers of a 2-year-old African penguin named Eddie. Then I felt something behind me. I swiveled around and found another penguin, Hope, tugging at my jacket's brass buttons. Meanwhile, Eddie was trying to grab my jacket's front zipper. No wonder penguins almost drove Mr. Popper crazy. The Maryland Zoo at Baltimore has been home to a colony of African penguins since 1967 - long enough that the zoo's on the verge of hatching its 1,000th chick. For most of that time, a moat or pool kept the penguins away from visitors. But when the penguins moved to a new enclosure a few years ago, the zoo began offering what it calls Penguin Encounters, a behind-the-scenes tour that allows visitors to meet "penguin ambassadors" and costs about $50, which supports the Maryland Zoo's breeding program for the endangered species. The 30-minute "encounters," offered a few times a day depending on the season, are every animal lover's dream: a chance to get up close to the flightless birds without being separated by fences or barriers, and even pet one. A group of up to eight visitors enter the penguins' carpeted home and sit on a long bench while zookeepers offer insight on the zoo's breeding program and the penguins' diet and social behavior.;

One of the most common questions, Talbot said, is whether visitors can feed the penguins.

Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net.; Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; the phenomena also includes supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which is the study of the Universe as a whole.Astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas, performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.; a critical step in creation of Wi-Fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging;

Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack, although authorities have said he was inspired - rather than directed - by the terrorist group. The FBI had previously investigated him for 10 months starting in 2013, but determined that he was not a threat. It was also revealed this week that his father, Seddique Mateen, had worked for more than a decade as an FBI informant, and he came under investigation after his son's attack when investigators found receipts for money transfers to Turkey and Afghanistan in his home.; [Orlando nightclub shooter's father was FBI informant, court documents say] Salman was arrested in January 2017 - several months after the shooting - and charged with aiding and abetting her husband's support of terrorism and obstructing law enforcement's investigation of the killings. A key issue in the trial was what she said to investigators probing her knowledge of her husband's plan. Prosecutors said Salman admitted that she knew of her husband's interest in radical terrorism, and she wrote during an FBI interview, "I am sorry for what happened. I wish I'd go back and tell his family and the police what he was going to do." Sweeney told jurors Tuesday that Salman "may be simple but she's not stupid," and that she did not have to be a "genius" to refuse to go along with her husband's massacre. "She's cold, she's callous and the only person she cares for is herself and maybe her child," Sweeney said.;

She said Salman also lied repeatedly, telling the FBI that Mateen had deleted his Facebook account, owned only one gun and was not radical in his beliefs. "The defendant knew her husband was planning a terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS," Sweeney said, referring to the Islamic State. Defense attorneys, though, countered that Salman was a victim of her husband's ma-nipu-la-tion and infidelity, and that she was effectively bullied by the FBI into admitting things that were demonstrably untrue.

Defense attorney Charles Swift said Salman admitted that Mateen had shown her the Pulse website, and that the two had scouted the club a few days before the attack. But computer and phone evidence, Swift said, indicated that neither of those things could be true - meaning law enforcement must have planted the idea in Salman's mind.; no_fact;

The fate of Noor Salman, 31, now lies in the hands of 12 men and women here who have for the past several weeks listened to testimony about the gruesome attack that killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub and Salman's interviews with the FBI immediately after it. Jurors began deliberating Wednesday afternoon. Salman's husband, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, was killed by police during the shooting, and his wife is the only one to face charges in connection with it. [At trial for Orlando club shooter's wife, jurors to decide: Did she help, or was she duped?] By prosecutors' telling, Salman was a willing participant in her husband's plot - even if she was not there the night of the attack, June 12, 2016. Federal prosecutor Sara Sweeney told jurors Wednesday that Mateen originally intended to attack the Disney Springs shopping complex, but changed course after seeing four officers in the nightclub area there.; no_fact;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor.

The party is named after republicanism, a major ideology of the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex-National Republicans, ex-Free Soilers and Whigs in 1854, the Republicans largely dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern states between 1860 and 1932.Originally, the GOP subscribed to what is referred to as classical liberalism with ideological stands that were anti-slavery and pro-economic reform. The party was usually dominant over the Democrats during the Third Party System and Fourth Party System. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt formed the Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party after being rejected by the GOP and ran as a candidate. He called for many social reforms, some of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s. He lost the election, and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they were at odds with the new conservative economic stance, leading to them leaving for the Democratic Party and an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party. The liberal New Deal Democrats dominated the Fifth Party System at the national level. The liberal Republican element was overwhelmed by a conservative surge begun by Barry Goldwater in 1964 and fulfilled during the Reagan Era.Currently, their ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' liberal platform and progressive wing. The GOP's political platform supports lower taxes, free market capitalism, free enterprise, a strong national defense, gun rights, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the Republican Party is socially conservative and seeks to uphold traditional values based largely on Judeo-Christian ethics. The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs from its founding until the 1930s when it was based in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. Since 1952, there has been a reversal against protectionism and for free trade. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. After the 1960s, whites increasingly identified with the Republican Party. After the Roe v. Wade 1973 Supreme Court ruling, the Republican Party made opposition to abortion a key plank of its national party platform and grew its support among Evangelicals. By 2000, the Republican party was firmly aligned with Christian conservatism. The party's core support since the 1990s comes chiefly from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North. Catholics were long the backbone of the Democratic Party, but since the 1970s have split about evenly, as well as racially, with white Catholics moving to the Republicans. Mormons are heavily Republican.Along with the GOP winning 24 of the last 40 presidential elections there have been a total of 19 Republican Presidents, the most from any one party. The first was 16th President Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 until his assassination in 1865; the most recent being the 45th and current president Donald Trump, who took the oath of office on January 20, 2017. However, the Republicans have lost the popular vote in six out of the last seven Presidential elections, as its traditional demographic is reducing as a proportion of the US population.As of  2018, the Republican Party is the primary party in power in the United States, holding the presidency (Donald Trump), majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, a majority of governorships and state legislatures (full control of 32/50, split control of five others); in the 2018 midterm elections, the GOP was voted out of the House, though it kept its Senate majority, with the new Congress to be inaugurated in 2019. Furthermore, the GOP presently hold "trifectas" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a "trifecta plus" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. They accomplished this partially through gerrymandering and controversial lame-duck legislation.; no_fact;

Doug Mayer, head of the governor's communications office, says the video series is designed as a fun way to catch the attention of people in a din of media and information. "It is a running laugh line in our office that lieutenant governor has a reputation for being boring, which really isn't true when you get to know him," Mayer says. "He's also a very humble person who has no problem poking fun at himself to educate the public or get the message out." In other words, boring can sell. One of the most popular viral campaign ads of 2016 featured a Republican county commissioner candidate droning about tax rates and light-rail capacity as his wife and neighbor's eyes glazed over. Rutherford's video hasn't done quite as well, but it had garnered a respectable 25,000 views as of Monday. Born in the District, Rutherford was a political independent as a young adult, joined the Democratic Party to vote in the primaries that almost always determine who will hold local office, and - after becoming disillusioned - registered as a Republican when he was in his late 30s. He served with Hogan in the Cabinet of Maryland's last Republican governor, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. An attorney by training who has worked for several companies, he also held various federal posts under President George W. Bush and was chief administrative officer of the Republican National Committee from 2009 to 2011. Rutherford shakes hands with longshoremen at the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore last summer.;

no_fact; A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state.  In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.; no_fact;

no_fact; Hogan, then a pugnacious and hard-charging conservative activist, tapped Rutherford as his running mate in 2014, eager for a partner willing to take on the unglamorous parts of governing a state. Rutherford's assignments have included leading commissions on regulatory and procurement reform and a task force on the opioid epidemic. When Hogan was being treated for cancer in 2015, his low-key deputy filled in at public appearances, upping his profile a bit. Now, as part of Hogan's bid to become the first Republican governor reelected in Maryland in 60 years, the governor's office is spotlighting some of Rutherford's work with a new video series called "Mundane (But Meaningful)." "There are quite a few regulations that serve no purpose other than to stand in the way of citizens, businesses and government working efficiently," Rutherford, sporting a gray sweater, says to the camera in the first installment about regulatory reform. Classical music, perhaps appropriate for PBS, hums in the background. Rutherford says he wasn't too keen on the series - proposed by Hogan's communications staff - until he read the script. A chance to talk up the basic government procedure that consumes his daily work seemed appealing to him. Ever the nit-picker, he corrected an improper reference to the title of the Maryland code in the script. "Some people don't know about these things," said Rutherford, glancing over at Hogan's press secretary, Shareese Churchill, who was sitting in on the interview, and swiveling to grab a binder from the floor nearby.;

And part of what he's looking to highlight in the video is how little Republican governance in Annapolis resembles Republican governance in Washington. "The difference between what we do here and what happens down the road is we are working to get things done," Rutherford said. Todd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary's College of Maryland, says the governor's office is smart to embrace Rutherford's dryness. "Now that they are running for reelection, I think one of the things they want to do is remind voters why they voted for Hogan-Rutherford in the first place: low-key, quiet, competent management," Eberly said. "It really does highlight a stark contrast with the cult of personality that comes out of the Trump administration."

no_fact; Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.; no_fact; Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.;

There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey and ice hockey.In most of the world, hockey refers to field hockey. However, in Canada, the United States, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, hockey usually refers to  ice hockey.; Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.; an average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.; no_fact;

no_fact; It was the first unit that played the majority of the woeful first half. The starters couldn't contain Charlotte in the pick and roll. The Hornets executed the two-man game between point guard Kemba Walker and Howard, then recycled the play over and over because - why not? The duo generated 22 of the Hornets' 38 points in the first quarter. "They were making every shot. We didn't make them feel us. We didn't put pressure on guys," Wall said. "They were basically running dummy offense and getting whatever they wanted and being the more aggressive team, so that's why they scored so high." [Mike Scott doesn't know hockey but he sure loves custom NHL jerseys] It didn't stop there. The starters' lack of resistance spread to the perimeter, where the Wizards gave up a pair of four-point plays in the game's first six minutes. At the 8:39 mark, Markieff Morris picked up his second foul after he closed late at the corner arc, but Marvin Williams still made the three-pointer. Just a few minutes later, Wall did the same against Walker. In the first half, Charlotte, which entered the game ranked 21st in the three-point percentage, made seven of its 14 attempts from the arc. Morris committed three fouls and couldn't stay on the floor longer than five minutes in the first half. Center Marcin Gortat played 14 minutes and registered minus-19 while on the floor due to Howard's strong play. As Gortat finished the game scoreless, Howard had 18 points and 15 rebounds and also got the last laugh. With four minutes to play, Tim Frazier grew angry at Hornets guard Michael Carter-Williams for going after Jason Smith.; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; It's about competing, and we didn't do that tonight." [In this era of progress, good is no longer good enough for inconsistent Wizards] Several poor defensive performances have blemished the schedule. In November, the Wizards gave up 130 points to the Cleveland Cavaliers. A month later, they were shamed in a 47-point loss to the Utah Jazz. But this was the Wizards at their worst - and their coach at his wit's end. "He's pissed. That's just plain and simple," Bradley Beal said. Although Brooks spent only a few minutes in the locker room following the game, his message could have lingering effects. According to Beal, Brooks was irate and more than hinted at changes coming to the rotation. "He's upset. He's mad. We're not giving him what he wants from a production standpoint. He's going to make a change, for sure," Beal said. "That's pretty much all I can say. He was beyond furious after the game, so guys should expect to play and not play. That was pretty much his message."

Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).;

HILLSBORO, Ohio After President Trump's less-than-stellar performance side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, many Trump critics may have hoped, reasonably, that Trump's approval ratings - already historically low compared with other presidents - would take a nose-dive. Instead, his numbers remained basically steady. A July NBC/Wall Street Journal sampling even found that Trump's approval rating climbed one point from the previous month, to 45 percent , and, most notably, his 88 percent approval among Republicans is the highest of his presidency. Republican pollster Bill McInturff, part of the team that conducted the poll, said the stability in the president's numbers was noteworthy, considering not only the widely panned summit with Putin but also other controversies, including the separation of families at the border and Trump's rocky NATO meetings. Trump's haters - it is not too strong a word - accuse the GOP base of abandoning its principles or being mindlessly enslaved to the "cult of Trump." It is time to consider that almost everyone has been misreading the Republican Party's core for several years. In 2008 and 2012, the eventual GOP nominee was, in both cases, a compromise candidate. Republicans were not particularly enthusiastic about either John McCain or Mitt Romney, each of whom amassed about 10 million votes in their respective primaries. By contrast, Trump racked up about 14 million primary votes in 2016.;

We're sissies," he would say, except sissies was not the word he used. Uncle Bill passed away in 2008 at age 84, and it is a cosmic injustice that he did not live to see Donald Trump become president. He would be gratified that, finally, there has arrived a Republican who won't apologize, come hell or high water, for wanting to enforce immigration laws, for demanding that our allies pony up more for our common defense and - most impressively, as far as the base is concerned - for giving as good as he gets from the media. It will pain #NeverTrump Republicans to admit it, but the party for which they pine has, for many years, been little more than a figment of their imaginations. The GOP base is not comprised of people wringing their hands over Trump's peccadilloes or embracing the left's laundry list of grievances. No, the GOP base is Uncle Bill. It is a coalition of die-hard partisans who have long resented Republicans, past and present, who surrender to Democrats or cater to the liberal media's definition of appropriateness.

every US president with a beard has been a Republican.; no_fact; For the base, that assessment represents long-standing policy, but they consider the effort wasted on Republicans who cave to criticism before the grass roots has time to rally to their side. I recently argued that the GOP has become the party of Trump. But it may be more accurate that the party of Trump has existed for years and has just been waiting for Trump to arrive. The base won't abandon him - not over Russia, not over family separations, not over Stormy Daniels and company, and certainly not over his attacks on the media. In 1992, Hillary Clinton famously protested that she wasn't just some Tammy Wynette-style wife blindly standing by her man despite her husband's philandering ways. She added, "I'm sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honor what he's been through and what we've been through together." Likewise, however badly Trump behaves, and regardless of the criticism he faces, grass-roots Republicans are standing by him and going through it with him, defiantly and without apology. They finally have the president they've been waiting for, and they're not letting him go.;

Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.

The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best-selling book of all time.Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek.

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment.

no_fact; On the eve of the Washington Redskins' game at the Chicago Bears on Dec. 13, 2015, the team's general manager, Scot McCloughan, approached Kirk Cousins's agent with a long-term contract offer. Cousins, 27 at the time, saw the appeal of a signing the deal, having labored as a backup to Robert Griffin III for three seasons. But his agent, Mike McCartney, advised against it - telling Cousins he would be better served by raising his level of play, finishing the season strong (the Redskins were then 5-7) and elevating his value in the process. Cousins did just that. He led the Redskins to four consecutive victories, throwing 12 touchdowns and one interception in that span, to clinch the NFC East title with a 9-7 finish. Since that pivotal moment - when McCloughan tried to lock up the Redskins' rising quarterback on terms favorable to the team but McCartney demurred - the two sides haven't come close to reaching a long-term agreement. [Steinberg: Cousins claims the moral high ground in dance with Redskins] That was among the nuggets Cousins disclosed in a two-hour forum with Redskins fans Friday to benefit charity, discuss his tenure in Washington and field questions about his uncertain future. Asked at the outset by hosts Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier of 106.7 the Fan whether he wanted to be a Redskin going forward, Cousins was met with applause for replying, "The short answer is yes." But he was quick to add: "It's not that simple or that easy." The conversation that followed between Cousins, perched on a chair atop a small stage at one end of Vienna's Jammin Java and roughly 170 Redskins fans, delved into the issues that complicate the quarterback's next step. At every juncture, Cousins, who is due to become a free agent for a third consecutive offseason, took the high road. What about the team's dysfunction?;

Cousins earned roughly $44 million from the back-to-back franchise tags while becoming a better player. He threw for more than 4,000 yards in each season as a starter while rushing for 13 touchdowns, and his passer rating over the three years was 97.6. If viewed as replaceable by the Redskins, Cousins is eyed as a rare commodity by NFL teams in need of a proven quarterback. Healthy, established quarterbacks in the prime of their careers rarely reach free agency, which makes establishing Cousins's market value difficult. The Redskins, meanwhile, appeared to send signals via Gruden's end-of-season news conference that they're not convinced Cousins is a franchise (i.e. top-dollar) quarterback. Asked Friday about the lukewarm endorsement, Cousins acknowledged he was a bit surprised to hear Gruden suggest that a 7-9 record and quarterback performance were "causally related." "It's slightly more complicated than that," Cousins said, acknowledging his poor play in the loss at New York. "His job is to evaluate. That's a big part of his role.

But his agent, Mike McCartney, advised against it - telling Cousins he would be better served by raising his level of play, finishing the season strong (the Redskins were then 5-7) and elevating his value in the process. Cousins did just that. He led the Redskins to four consecutive victories, throwing 12 touchdowns and one interception in that span, to clinch the NFC East title with a 9-7 finish. Since that pivotal moment - when McCloughan tried to lock up the Redskins' rising quarterback on terms favorable to the team but McCartney demurred - the two sides haven't come close to reaching a long-term agreement. [Steinberg: Cousins claims the moral high ground in dance with Redskins] That was among the nuggets Cousins disclosed in a two-hour forum with Redskins fans Friday to benefit charity, discuss his tenure in Washington and field questions about his uncertain future. Asked at the outset by hosts Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier of 106.7 the Fan whether he wanted to be a Redskin going forward, Cousins was met with applause for replying, "The short answer is yes." But he was quick to add: "It's not that simple or that easy." The conversation that followed between Cousins, perched on a chair atop a small stage at one end of Vienna's Jammin Java and roughly 170 Redskins fans, delved into the issues that complicate the quarterback's next step. At every juncture, Cousins, who is due to become a free agent for a third consecutive offseason, took the high road. What about the team's dysfunction?;

Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of "The TB12 Method," Brady's best-selling "athlete's bible" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is "Tom vs. Time," a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. "What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game," Chopra said. "It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose." The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.; no_fact; no_fact;

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

no_fact; Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.;

Allen apologized, called himself "young and dumb" and eventually was picked in the first round by the Buffalo Bills. Villanova basketball player Donte DiVincenzo experience similar scrutiny the night of the NCAA championship game. While social media and Twitter have grown embedded in sports and society, athletes in their early 20s are among the first generation who have built an archive of their personal thoughts online, and therefore among the first generation exposed to having their past surface in damaging fashion. Leagues and teams, then, are also navigating new territory, forced to determine the proper response to actions made by players before they were their employees, often before legal adulthood. Should players be punished for actions taken years ago - and would it even be legal under a collective bargaining agreement? Is public shame and counseling enough? Doug Hartmann, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota who has written extensively on race and sports, said he believed MLB erred in deciding so quickly to only condemn Hader without punishing him, rather than looking further into his tweets and beliefs. "They're trying to already forgive him and make space for him to move on," Hartmann said. "We've tried to protect the heroic image, the role model image of athletes, especially superstars. I don't know that we give the same benefit of the doubt to everyone on all the different issues that are going on in society right now.";

no_fact; 29 overall to Jacksonville, according to ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. Carolina could be an option before that at No. 24, while other sites have Moore pegged as high as No. 16 overall to Baltimore. Panthers OC Norv Turner had DJ Moore run each of these routes at pro day. He seems to really like the Maryland WR. Rightfully so. - TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) March 28, 2018 "As far as round-wise, [scouts] don't really talk about it.;
Maryland's DJ Moore. Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner was one of the first to greet DJ Moore after his workout at Maryland's pro day in College Park on Wednesday. Turner, alongside scouts from 30 other teams, had just put Moore through a gamut of route-running skills, further evaluating the mechanics of a player who burst onto the scene as a potential first-round pick after an impressive showing at the NFL combine. Moore flashed a grin as he hugged Turner - Carolina will be one of the teams he meets with in the coming weeks, with visits also lined up with the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots - and he quickly made the rounds with other giddy NFL talent evaluators inside Cole Field House. It wasn't difficult to see why Moore was the featured prospect in College Park on Wednesday; none of his former teammates, save perhaps defensive back J.C. Jackson, are projected to be selected in next month's draft. But the more pressing question is where Moore ranks among the top receivers in the entire draft class, a status he joined after he measured taller than expected at 6 feet (210 pounds) and ran faster than expected with a 4.42 40-yard dash, not to mention an 11-foot broad jump that underscored his freakish athleticism. Most mock drafts have vaulted Moore into the first round; the Philadelphia native is currently projected to go No.;
They just tell me I'm a great player and my ceiling is so high," Moore said, adding that he's intrigued by the idea of possibly staying local and playing in Washington or Baltimore, or in his home town of Philadelphia. On Wednesday, he hoped to show those scouts that he has been polishing his route-running. He particularly has been trying to hone how he runs out of his breaks; while Moore was named the Big Ten's top receiver in 2017 largely because of his explosiveness in runs after the catch, scouts have been looking for that same burst and consistency earlier in his route running. [They fell to Maryland's QB injury curse. Now they will try to break it together.] But Moore has also been lauded for his ability to adapt as a player during three turbulent seasons at Maryland, where he played with eight  quarterbacks and still cemented his place as one of the program's best ever at the position. Turner and the Panthers assigned Moore to their own route-running drills on Wednesday, and the player throwing for drills was one of those eight players under center that threw to Moore in his college career: former Terrapins quarterback and current graduate assistant Caleb Rowe.; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact; no_fact;

Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.; no_fact;

From there, "My Love Story" stops being a tell-all and becomes a DIY guide to successful branding. There's actually not a lot about music here. In her telling, Tina's contribution to rock and soul is a combination of the strength of her personality and a vocal power to match. In a pair of passages, she describes how she stamped her distinctive style on two of her biggest hits, "Proud Mary" and "What's Love Got to Do With It?". But that's it as far the music goes. (Atria) The bulk of this book is about becoming somebody and marketing that person to the world. When Tina emerges from Ike's shadow and steps finally to the front of the stage, she has every detail covered and leaves nothing to chance, not even the wig she describes as "a critical part of the Tina Turner look." She's so good at branding that producers of "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" referred to the movie's larger-than-life heroine as "the Tina Turner character.

Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).; there are legless lizards that are basically lizards without limbs, but not snakes.; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes.

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

Constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain; It is quite difficult to keep track of all the cheesy, made-for-television holiday movies released this time of year &mdash; but it certainly helps if one of them goes viral.Thanks to that creepy tweet from Netflix last year, in which the streaming behemoth reminded everyone it&rsquo;s constantly watching and analyzing your viewing data, &ldquo;A Christmas Prince&rdquo; became something of an Internet sensation. The movie wasn&rsquo;t good &mdash; in fact, it was kind of terrible. But like all good TV movies, that made it even more fun to watch.Naturally, Netflix commissioned a sequel: &ldquo;A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding,&rdquo; which started streaming Friday.

Amber&rsquo;s task was to report on Prince Richard (also known as &ldquo;His Royal Hotness,&rdquo; played by Ben Lamb of &ldquo;The White Queen&rdquo;), who might abdicate the throne after his father&rsquo;s death and throw the whole country into chaos.Amber was mistaken for Richard&rsquo;s younger sister&rsquo;s tutor, so she found herself with the undercover scoop of a lifetime. Naturally, she wound up falling for Richard (because that&rsquo;s what female journalists do in movies), and he was very hurt when he found out her true identity.;

Snake Eyes was one of the most popular "G.I. Joe" characters, both in the comics and in various animated series and even the "G.I. Joe" live-action movies. Hama killed off the character in the comics in 2015 but saved the name for Dawn Moreno, the young Latina who now takes on the mantle of Snake Eyes, which comes with the ninja's memories. Hama is aware of diversity efforts at major comic publishers such as DC Entertainment and Marvel Comics where people of color have assumed well-known comic book mantles, such as Miles Morales/Spider-Man and Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel. But he says the idea for Dawn Moreno as Snake Eyes came from female "G.I. Joe" cosplayers who complained to him that there weren't enough female characters. [A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic that won't always star the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles] "I started thinking about what kind of outfit a female cosplayer would be excited about," Hama said. "So, yes, it was sparked by inclusion, and then I thought, why not make her a young Latina?" The character has received a positive reaction from fans, and the issues are flying off the shelves. Hama attributes the success to giving a new idea a chance without worrying about the "G.I.;

You&rsquo;ve been very open about how you channel your anxiety into the stories you write. Can you elaborate on how writing has been a helpful coping tool? I&rsquo;ve always been anxious. I used to get it a lot worse, and it would kind of stop me from functioning as a person. It got a lot better once I started incorporating it into my writing. People who write horror are often asked if the things we write scare us, and the answer, for me at least, is no &mdash; because that was already in my head. I&rsquo;m just getting it out of my head and putting it into yours, so in that way, it&rsquo;s making it less scary for me.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy.

Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).; no_fact; a man in France impersonated a government official, and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice.;

The Redskins could also look to Kevin O'Connell, who was just promoted from quarterbacks coach to passing game coordinator, for other RPO concepts. O'Connell served as the quarterbacks coach in San Francisco in 2016 under Chip Kelly. Kelly didn't necessarily bring RPOs to the NFL during his time with the Eagles and 49ers, but he certainly popularized them. One of his favorite RPOs is the tight end pop pass. This concept works similarly to the RPO slant, with the quarterback reading a specific defender for his key to hand off or throw. The quarterback reads pass, so he pulls the ball from the running back and hits the tight end up the seam for a big gain. While Gruden said he sees it as a change-of-pace option, the success of RPOs has spread quickly around the league, most noticeably with the Eagles during their Super Bowl run. There are various types of RPOs used around the NFL and even more in college football. In Smith and O'Connell, the Redskins have two strong resources experienced in RPOs in their own building.;

no_fact; no_fact; Another type of RPO the Chiefs used often involved keying a particular defender and making the decision to hand off based on his reaction to the snap. Instead of reading the numbers in the box pre-snap, the quarterback has to read a particular player, in this case the weakside, or Will, linebacker. If the linebacker steps up to play the run, Smith can throw the slant to Hill in the vacated space behind him. But if the linebacker drops into coverage, Smith will hand it off knowing he has a favorable box count. The Will reads run and steps up toward the line of scrimmage, telling Smith to keep the ball and throw to Hill, who picks up 26 yards on the play before being tackled. The Redskins ran this play last season against the Chargers in Week 14. Ryan Grant was the receiver to make the catch, but didn't quite have the speed to break away from the defense. This is perhaps a concept the Redskins could look to run with new addition Paul Richardson, who has the speed to run away from defenders. The Chiefs had various twists on their RPO concepts, like this one. The idea of this concept is to isolate a receiver on the back side of a run, usually tight end Travis Kelce, and have him run an out route.;

no_fact; Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.;

no_fact; The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".;

In 2018, he ranks 23rd with a QBR of 44.0.The Texans' defense also is struggling, allowing more than two points per drive (ninth-most) despite forcing opponents to go three-and-out more than a third of the time (39 percent, eighth).;

Instead they have 23, and they&rsquo;re scoring less than one point per drive. Only Arizona is worse.And here&rsquo;s the good news for Buffalo&rsquo;s defense: It can&rsquo;t get any worse. The Bills are allowing a league-high three points per drive in addition to a whopping 90 percent conversion rate in the red zone.It might be time to move on from Eli Manning. The 37-year-old has a high completion rate, 69 percent, but a career-low 4.8 adjusted net yards per pass, an updated form of the more well-known passer rating. His QBR is also in its third year of decline, indicating his performance is 2018 is good enough to win just 33 percent of his games played, which roughly translates to a 5-11 record over a full season.Big Blue&rsquo;s defense, on the other hand, is playing well. PFF ranks its secondary and pass rush as the 12th-best in the league, resulting in a below-average adjusted net yards (5.5) and passer rating against (81.6).Detroit&rsquo;s offense has sputtered (nine fewer points than expected), and Matthew Stafford ranks 29th of 32 qualified passers in QBR thanks to a league-leading four interceptions.;

But that&rsquo;s not even the team&rsquo;s biggest concern: The holes in the defense have been big enough to drive a truck through.The Lions' run defense is allowing 5.6 yards per carry, second-most in the NFL, with 3.1 yards per carry occurring after contact. Defensive lineman Ricky Jean Francois and linebackers Christian Jones and Jarrad Davis have received low, negative grades from PFF for their run defense.Oakland&rsquo;s pass rush has suffered mightily after trading 2017 defensive player of the year Khalil Mack to the Bears before the season. Raiders defenders have been credited with 17 total sacks, hits and hurries, just four more than Mack has for his new team.On offense, Jon Gruden&rsquo;s system relies on quarterback Derek Carr connecting on short and intermediate routes in addition to getting the ball out as quickly as possible, but that hasn&rsquo;t worked out. On throws when Carr holds the ball for 2.5 seconds or less, he is 42 for 50 (84 percent) with four interceptions and a 74.3 passer rating. When he holds the ball for longer than that, his passer rating jumps to 115.7. If Carr can get comfortable throwing the ball more quickly, as he did last season (96.5 passer rating), the Raiders could crawl their way back to contention.Division leaders a few years ago, Arizona is being outscored by 16.4 points per game after adjusting for strength of schedule. If that level of mediocrity is sustained, it would be the second-worst campaign in franchise history, slightly behind the 1944 squad, a team created with the wartime merger of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Cardinals.Using more traditional metrics, the 2018 Cardinals rank last or second to last in net yards per pass (3.6), scoring rate (5 percent of drives end in points), yards per drive (17.5), points per drive (0.4), first downs allowed (54), net yards per pass allowed (8.8), average time per drive allowed (3:37), plays allowed per drive (7.2) and yards allowed per drive (43).;

The violin, also known informally as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno). ;
there is a violin made out of stone that is fully playable;

A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot while the wearer is doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair.

Images taken by the ATLAS telescopes before the explosion (middle) and after it (left) show the sudden brightening in the galaxy CGCG 137-068. The far-right image shows the difference between the two. (Stephen Smartt/ATLAS) A mysterious cataclysm in a neighboring galaxy was spotted in the sky above Hawaii last week, sending astronomers around the world scrambling to understand the source of the staggeringly brilliant flash. "I've never seen anything like this before in the local universe," said Stephen Smartt, an astrophysicist at Queen's University Belfast and a lead scientist for the Hawaii-based ATLAS survey, which first observed the object. The June 16 detection was first posted on the Astronomer's Telegram, an online service for astronomers to rapidly report interesting new observations. Thanks to the site's randomized three-letter naming system, the object has been dubbed AT2018cow, or "the cow" for short. It immediately stood out to Smartt because it was so unlike a standard exploding star. Most events like it take several weeks to reach peak luminosity, but in the course of just three days, AT2018cow became about 10 times as bright as a normal supernova.; The object quickly captured other astronomers' attention. In the week since, the ATLAS observation has been followed up by about two dozen teams of astronomers using telescopes based on at least four continents and in space. "I think it's the most notices for any individual object in such a short period of time," said Robert Rutledge, editor in chief of the Astronomer's Telegram and an astrophysicist at McGill University in Canada. "It has produced a lot of interest." Smartt initially suspected the flash must have come from something in our own galaxy, because it was so bright. But when other scientists conducted spectroscopic analyses of the object, separating the light out into its component wavelengths, it turned out that AT2018cow had features associated with CGCG 137-068, a galaxy in the constellation Hercules. Its light bore the signature of having been stretched out over the course of its 200-million-light-year journey from that galaxy to Earth. That's not far, by astronomical standards, which means the explosion may have produced detectable gravitational waves.;

The strong X-ray and radio signals also suggest that the explosion produced a jet of particles moving close to the speed of light. "This does look like it is quite a rare object," Smartt said. "Just the fact that it's detected over all these wavelengths leaves a lot of rich physics to understand." These are just the early stages of the scientific process, he noted. The Astronomer's Telegram isn't a peer-reviewed journal, and the observations of AT2018cow still require months of additional research and analysis before they can be formally published. But this is a fun chance to watch astronomers get excited about something strange and potentially new in real time.

According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year.Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years.Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms.Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago.Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.; the universe may be one giant superhologram;

A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.; Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun; Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities;

It's inevitable." Those close to Smith rave about his intelligence on and off the field and say his raw ability is often overlooked. He's not the flashiest, but he went 50-26 as a starter in Kansas City, was selected to three Pro Bowls and led the team to the playoffs in four of five seasons. He also reached career highs with 4,042 passing yards and 26 touchdowns in 2017. The Redskins hope consistency at the position from a quarterback who never threw more than eight interceptions in a season with the Chiefs will hasten their return to the postseason. But that's just the beginning of the expectations at Redskins Park; players, coaches and the front office believe there's an opportunity to win on a grand scale sooner than later. The organization has two winning seasons and one playoff berth in the past five years. "It's all about winning a championship," Davis said. "We want to win that championship.

But he doesn't, and we're not. Forgotten will be Monday's events - the reports of a raving Trump calling the wife of acting FBI director Andrew McCabe a "loser;" of the president being irate over the Department of Justice's attempt to prevent the release of a memo damaging to national security; and of him being determined to fire McCabe, who was told about former FBI director James B. Comey's conversations with the president, making him a witness to alleged obstruction. Rather than point out that those revelations confirm Trump is temperamentally unfit for the job, and is uninterested in anything other than protecting his own hide, he'll be patted on the head for reading off a teleprompter. The usual play-acting associated with the State of the Union address is bad enough, but with this president it is hard to imagine how it could provide any insight into his thinking. There are two Trumps. The first one can get through a speech in the House chamber or at Davos by sticking to a script written by mainstream conservatives. The second has no interest in policy, no idea how to achieve it, no comprehension of American institutions, and no ability to lead the free world. In other words, we get either an entirely artificial and unrepresentative articulation of his presidency, or a raving, ignorant, race-baiter. The two have nothing to do with one another. In this respect, we should stop paying attention to the prepared speeches (goodness knows our international allies must have at this point), and focus on his tweets - the exact opposite of what his apologists urge.;

no_fact; no_fact; the most popular hat in the old west was the bowler, not the cowboy hat; A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects and a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and a Ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs. Some hats have religious functions, such as the mitres worn by Bishops and the turban worn by Sikhs.;

no_fact; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).; no_fact; there are no snakes in New Zealand;

You do that, you can have a big impact on the team.&rdquo;Rooney has more Twitter followers than all of D.C.'s other sports stars combined, but unlike back home in England, he said he can go places in D.C. with his wife and four sons without worrying about being hounded by paparazzi.&ldquo;Just to go out with my children here is a lot different than going out with them back home,&rdquo; Rooney said. &ldquo;You can do it back home, but it&rsquo;s a bit more planned. .;
I think if you&rsquo;ve got regrets about leaving the league then you might find it difficult. The same with England, watching the World Cup, if you have regret, you might find it difficult to watch them play in the tournament. But I&rsquo;m a person once I make a decision, I stick by it and I don&rsquo;t have any regrets.&rdquo;The five-hour time difference between D.C. and England is great for Rooney&rsquo;s soccer-watching habits, but it&rsquo;s put a damper on one of his other favorite pastimes.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult for me to play FIFA with my friends at the minute,&rdquo; Rooney said when asked what he misses most about England. &ldquo;We used to play back home when my kids were in bed. My friends would finish work and we would play about nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening is four o&rsquo;clock here and it&rsquo;s right in the middle of the kids finishing school, and I need to try and find a slot when I can play. "For now, Rooney will have to settle for putting up video game numbers for suddenly unstoppable D.C. United.Check out Bennett&rsquo;s full interview with Rooney here.;

The beginning of fantasy football season has all owners full of hope, yet it can also be frustrating to decide on your lineup. After all, there is no recent track record on which to base this season's decisions. You can, however, focus more on matchups, a key ingredient in determining who to start or sit in the opening weeks, as well as performance in previous seasons. Quarterbacks facing teams without premier pass rushers are prized while those without the necessary skill players are risky propositions. And who wants to deal with added risk when bragging rights are on the line? [Experts' mock draft analysis] Luckily, you've found a shortcut: Here are three players to start and three to sit in your fantasy football league this week. Start Andy Dalton, QB, Cincinnati Bengals The Bengals' offensive line should have no trouble keeping Dalton clean in the pocket against the Indianapolis Colts, and the team also shouldn't have to worry about errant passes being intercepted. The Colts feature one above-average pass rusher, Jabaal Sheard, and the league's worst secondary according to the game charters at Pro Football Focus.; no_fact; Those Humungous American Flags at Football Stadiums Weigh 1,100 Pounds and Cost $50,000 to Make;

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.; Sit Jimmy Garoppolo, QB, San Francisco 49ers There is a lot of hype surrounding Garoppolo's first season in San Francisco, but expectations should be kept low in Week 1 of the season. The 49ers will be without running back Jerick McKinnon, eliminating a vital element in the rushing and passing game, and their offensive line will have to contend with a Vikings pass rush that ranks among the best in the NFL. [The best available fantasy football defense for every week of 2018] And like most quarterbacks, Garoppolo's production suffers under pressure. His on-target rate dropped from 83 to 72 percent and his interception rate ballooned from less than 1 percent to almost 7 percent when dealing with a pass rush last season, causing a similar decline in his overall passer rating: 104.4 to 82.8 when under duress. Chris Carson, RB, Seattle Seahawks It's hard to find an offensive line worse at run blocking than Seattle's. Left tackle Duane Brown and right guard D.J. Fluker can hold their own, but per PFF, right tackle Germain Ifedi ranked 80th out of 82 tackles for his run-blocking ability. Left guard Ethan Pocic ranked 59th out of 80 qualified players at the position, and center Justin Britt finished the season at 23rd overall among 38 centers.;

Posted by Pete Carroll on Thursday, May 31, 2018 Peterson's appearance before Seattle's staff did not go unnoticed and, when asked by reporters, Carroll explained Peterson's message was one of "personal growth." He added that Peterson "talked about perspective and life and working together and helping each other find our best, things that really rang true to us around here." A recent New York Times profile noted that Peterson's message is that "there's no shame in looking backward to a model of how the world should be arranged. Look back to the 1950s, he says - and back even further." His book, "12 Rules for Life," was published in January and has sold more than 1.1 million copies. He earns over $80,000 a month on donations to his YouTube channel, the Times reported, and his online personality tests and self-improvement writing exercises also are popular. His message might appear awkward for the NFL, which has dealt with both a domestic violence crisis and a spate of stories about the treatment of cheerleaders in recent years. Carroll admitted that there are "varying opinions" when it comes to Peterson, but he doesn't shy from those.

no_fact; Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.;

"Silent Night," by composer Kevin Puts and librettist Mark Campbell, is such a work, commissioned in 2011 by the Minnesota Opera and based on the French film "Joyeux Noel," about the Christmas Truce of 1914 in which soldiers in the trenches laid down their arms for a few hours during World War I. The opera has, in material terms, succeeded; it won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012, and it has had multiple productions, including revivals that opened at the Washington National Opera and the Minnesota Opera on Saturday night. Yet in theatrical terms, and in musical ones, it simply isn't very good. War is hell, indeed. "Once your sworn enemy ceases to be faceless, war becomes far less possible," the composer wrote in a program note, and the opera illustrates this message, introducing a string of amiable two-dimensional stereotypes, in three languages (German, French and English heavily distorted by fake Scots accents), in a story of three nations meeting in a moment of brotherhood. It's a message we all want, and one, evidently, that dovetails well with what classical music lovers want from their music: tonality, sweetness and a reaffirmation of general truths.

no_fact; [Want to commemorate Armistice Day? Classical music thinks you should.] Presenting new work is a struggle for any opera company: It's expensive to put on, hard to find singers to learn new roles they may not get to reprise and a big risk at the box office. "Silent Night" has showed itself to be popular with audiences; as for the other two points, WNO addressed them by paring down the scale of the production and turning to its young-artist program for the singers. The piece is staged in the Eisenhower Theater, in a reduced version for 40 instruments jointly commissioned with Opera Parallele, a small opera company in San Francisco founded by the evening's conductor, Nicole Paiement. Forty instruments is a lot by chamber-opera standards, but the result sounded a little dull in Paiement's accurate rendering (this is her third time conducting a run of this opera). As for the singers, the evening was not a great recommendation for WNO's young artists and alums, though there were a few standouts. Alexey Bogdanov, as the German commander Lt.

The fear of snakes is hard-wired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains.; Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.  Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).; no_fact; no_fact;

Switzer (@wrongsideofpond) September 10, 2018 I was wondering when the Geico gecko was gonna hit his punk phase  - Brawn Hextall (@NotTheRealGoose) September 10, 2018 But the Philadelphia Union, currently in fifth place in the MLS's Eastern Conference, appeared prepared for such questions. The organization soon provided a completely reasonable explanation for how a snake spawned limbs to transform into a soccer-playing reptile. "Long story short," the team explained concisely on Twitter, "a regular snake tied a ball to an old metal cleat, got struck by lightning, turned into an egg & was reborn with arms & legs." As the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, team management decided to solicit ideas for the mascot from children this year after families repeatedly asked why the team, whose home games attract about 16,400 people on average, didn't have a spirit leader. They received more than 3,000 drawings, with snake being a top contender. It made sense: There is a rattlesnake on the team's logo, an intended reference to Benjamin Franklin's famous "Join, or Die" political cartoon featuring the spliced rattlesnake. According to Phang's official life story, his ancestor was actually the snake featured in the cartoon, which is what inspired Phang to conduct an experiment with metal soccer cleats in a lightning storm. David Raymond, the character branding consultant and also the original performer in the Phillie Phanatic mascot costume, told the Inquirer that while the Union anticipated some fans would be skeptical, the team was not trying to please adults. "When I was working with [the Union]," Raymond told the Inquirer's Anna Orso, "they said, 'We know that there's going to be a period of time where this isn't going to be popular with our fans, but we're doing this because we need to engage youth.; no_fact; there are legless lizards that are basically lizards without limbs, but not snakes.;
no_fact; We are going to stand behind it.'" Phang is among a number of new mascots to cause a stir this year after their coming-out parties on social media. In August, Ole Miss unveiled a new mascot, Landshark Tony, whose smile full of sharp teeth and enormous, slightly squinting black eyes struck students as somewhat terrifying. In January, the Atlanta Braves unveiled Blooper, who looks strikingly like Bigfoot from another planet and who was not initially universally welcomed by fans. In Philadelphia, Phang will join the 76ers' blue dog named Franklin, the Eagles mascot named Swoop and the fuzzy green flightless bird from the Gal?pagos Islands famously known as the Phillie Phanatic, the mascot for the Phillies. No one quite knew what type of creature Phillie Phanatic was either when he announced himself to the world during a 1978 episode of the children's television show "Captain Noah and his Magical Ark." Now, he's among the most beloved mascots in sports history. I like that they have a mascot but a wise friend on my TL just rightly asked why the snake has hands  - Arielle Castillo (@ariellec) September 10, 2018;
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature  that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy.Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony.Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.;

In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

no_fact; In a modern sense, Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old." A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

no_fact; Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.; Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
