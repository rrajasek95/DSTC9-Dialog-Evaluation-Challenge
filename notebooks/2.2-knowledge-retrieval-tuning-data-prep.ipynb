And people can't get enough of these reactions. \"I love it,\" said longtime local hockey analyst Alan May, who like me, has been captivated by this development. \"It's childlike, and I'm saying that in a good way.

His strength was attacking the rim and a solid midrange game, Jones said. He still averaged 15.2 points and 4.8 rebounds his senior season at AU. \"He was our best player through the course of his career,\" Jones said. Former American University star Andre Ingram, 32, finally got his NBA shot. (American University) But Ingram went undrafted by the NBA out of college and was selected in the seventh round of the G League draft, where he became one of the NBA's best prospects to never get called up. He played 384 games in that developmental circuit, an entire career's worth of trips to places like Sioux Falls and Des Moines. And through those years in the development league, first with the Utah Flash then with the South Bay Lakers, Ingram steadily improved until his style suited an NBA game that includes more three-pointers, more fast breaks and less defense. His last three years in the G League, Ingram shot better than 49 percent beyond the arc. His 47.5 percent clip this season is the best in the G League. The happy coincidence of the season's end, his elevated play and injuries to some of the Lakers' stars - guard Isaiah Thomas is out for the year, Lonzo Ball missed Tuesday's game with a knee injury, and Kyle Kuzma was out with a bum ankle - finally delivered Ingram this chance a decade in the making. \"It was all the emotions you'd think,\" Ingram said before Tuesday's game.</th>\n",

He has been suspended repeatedly under the NFL's substance abuse policy and has played in only 11 regular season NFL games since his breakout season in 2013. His return to the Browns this season lasted all of one game until team officials were left with their patience exhausted and feeling that Gordon had run out of chances with the organization. Belichick may bring out Gordon's best. He is a coach for the ages, but his history with taking chances on players with sullied reputations is mixed. Gordon could be another Moss for Belichick and Brady. Moss had three 1,000-yard receiving seasons with the Patriots, including the wondrous 2007 season in which Brady-to-Moss was as unstoppable as it gets and New England was unbeaten until its stunning Super Bowl defeat to the New York Giants. Or Gordon could be another Albert Haynesworth, whose Patriots tenure lasted six games in 2011 and included three tackles and no sacks. Belichick's coaching magic is not absolute in these cases. All the Patriots have put at risk is the conditional fifth-round draft pick they sent to the Browns in the deal. The trade signals just how badly the Patriots need help at wide receiver. They have made one move after another at the position since March, and the situation remains unsettled. Wide receivers Chris Hogan, Phillip Dorsett and Cordarrelle Patterson totaled 11 catches for 104 yards in Sunday's loss at Jacksonville.</th>\n",

      "Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), known mononymously as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur. Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, \"One Dance\", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks. Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. Its lead single \"Hotline Bling\" received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song. In 2017, he released the mixtape More Life. Described by Drake as a \"playlist\", it became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and housed the number-one singles \"God's Plan\", and the bounce-infused \"Nice for What\" and \"In My Feelings\".\n",

      "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which \"oral historians\", or \"praise-singers\", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to \"praise or critique individuals.\" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the \"Black rhetorical continuum\", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through \"creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of \"delivering rhymes over extensive music\", that would become known as rap, was Anthony \"DJ Hollywood\" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant \"to lightly strike\", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning \"to converse\", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.\n",

      "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which \"oral historians\", or \"praise-singers\", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to \"praise or critique individuals.\" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets.

Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years.

      "\n",
      "ST. ALBANS, England - Cheers, it's \"Beer Day Britain!\" Not that anyone here really needs a marketing ploy as an excuse, mind you. It could be National Jellied Eels Day, and the pubs would be packed in Britain on a sunny Friday afternoon in June. This ancient Cathedral city, about an hour's drive north of London, harbors the oldest continuous site of Christian worship in Britain - and boasts more pubs per capita than any town in England, and that's saying something. But these are anxious days for the British pub and its fans. The number of pubs has been in decline for years, as the traditional taverns fall victim to myriad forces, from corporatized \"global beer\" conglomeration to steep business tax rates to the more moderate drinking habits of Generation X - versus their thirsty coal-mining, steel-smelting, shipbuilding forebears. About 18 pubs close every week in Britain, reports Katie Wiles of the Campaign for Real Ale, which champions traditional beers and pubs. The group commissioned a 2016 study by the University of Oxford's department of experimental psychology that found Brits who have a \"local,\" a neighborhood pub they frequent enough to get a nod when they walk through the door, are \"happier,\" more \"connected\" and \"more trusting of others\" (especially after they've had a pint or two; it's in the study). There are about 25,000 fewer pubs in Britain now than there were in the 1970s. But there's still 50,000 of them left. \"A pub closing is big drama for the people involved, no doubt, but this is Britain, and there will always be thousands and thousands of pubs,\" said Fiona Stapley, editor of the \"Good Pub Guide ,\" which reviews 5,000 drinking establishments each year. \"You could say that before, there were probably too many pubs,\" Stapley added. \"And many were not run as well as they could have been.\" There's other goodish news, too, for beer people. There are more breweries operating in Britain today - about 2,000 - than in any time since the 1930s. There's a revival in \"real ales\" fermented in casks and pumped by hand into a pint glass.\n",

(Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images) LeBron James has said that he wants to stick around the NBA long enough to play with his oldest son - or perhaps simply own an NBA team and sign his kid to play for it - and the youngster is doing his best to hold up his end of the bargain. LeBron James Jr. hasn't even played eighth-grade basketball yet, but he's already a phenom with highlight videos and overflow - and occasionally out-of-control - crowds to his AAU games. Of course, the basketball ability of James Jr., nicknamed \"Bronny,\" isn't the only thing driving all the interest in him, and his superstar father recently addressed the pressure his son might be feeling to live up to his name. In a recent video, James said that he regretted giving his name to his son, but he explained that it stemmed from his own experience of growing up without a father. James made his comments in a clip released Thursday from \"The Shop,\" a show he is producing for HBO that features \"spirited, free-flowing discussions,\" in a barbershop setting. In the clip, former \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart asks James, \"What do you say to our kids, though, living up to you being their dad, and they're playing the same sport that you've played better than anyone else in the world has ever played it. How do you give them a peace of mind that they don't have to be you?\" \"I still regret giving my 14-year-old my name because of that,\" James replies, while holding court in a room with, among others, Snoop Dogg, Draymond Green, Candace Parker, Odell Beckham Jr. and Michael Bennett. \"When I was younger, I didn't have a dad,\" he continues. \"So my whole thing was like, 'Whenever I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr., I'm going to do everything that this man didn't do.'\n",

Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui (1952–2004). The grandson of Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea from 1948 to 1994, he is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding.From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as heir apparent to the leadership of the DPRK, and following the elder Kim's death, he was announced as the \"Great Successor\" by North Korean state television. Kim holds the titles of Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (as First Secretary between 2012 and 2016), Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, the highest decision-making body in North Korea. Kim was promoted to the rank of Marshal of North Korea in the Korean People's Army on 18 July 2012, consolidating his position as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and is often referred to as Marshal Kim Jong-un or \"the Marshal\" by state media. Kim obtained two degrees, one in physics at Kim Il-sung University, and another as an Army officer at the Kim Il-sung Military University.Forbes magazine ranked Kim the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013 and the third highest amongst Koreans after Ban Ki-moon and Lee Kun-hee. On 12 December 2013, North Korean news outlets reported that Kim Jong-un had ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek due to \"treachery\". On 9 March 2014, Kim was elected unopposed to the Supreme People's Assembly. He is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia in February 2017.Despite tense relations, North Korea agreed to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Following the Olympics, Kim Jong-un and President Moon Jae-in conducted the April 2018 inter-Korean summit. It was the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South's territory. On 12 June 2018, Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump met for the 2018 North Korea–United States summit in Singapore, the first-ever talks held between a North Korean leader and a sitting US President, to discuss the North Korean nuclear program.\n",

      "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which \"oral historians\", or \"praise-singers\", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to \"praise or critique individuals.\" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets.

      "\n",
      "Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), known mononymously as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur. Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, \"One Dance\", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks. Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. Its lead single \"Hotline Bling\" received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song. In 2017, he released the mixtape More Life. Described by Drake as a \"playlist\", it became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and housed the number-one singles \"God's Plan\", and the bounce-infused \"Nice for What\" and \"In My Feelings\".\n",

Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui (1952–2004). The grandson of Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea from 1948 to 1994, he is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding.From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as heir apparent to the leadership of the DPRK, and following the elder Kim's death, he was announced as the \"Great Successor\" by North Korean state television. Kim holds the titles of Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (as First Secretary between 2012 and 2016), Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, the highest decision-making body in North Korea.

On 9 March 2014, Kim was elected unopposed to the Supreme People's Assembly. He is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia in February 2017.Despite tense relations, North Korea agreed to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

      "[Head of Pentagon's secret 'UFO' office sought to make evidence public] Although there has been no confirmation - or even serious suggestions - that the recent incident was related to an unidentified flying object (at least, not the kind portrayed in Hollywood), the U.S. government has investigated sightings over the years. For the first time last year, the Pentagon confirmed that it had run an operation, known as the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, to investigate reported UFO sightings. In December, The Post's Joby Warrick reported: Current and former Pentagon officials confirm that the Pentagon program has been in existence since 2007 and was formed for the purpose of collecting and analyzing a wide range of \"anomalous aerospace threats\" ranging from advanced aircraft fielded by traditional U.S. adversaries to commercial drones to possible alien encounters. It is a rare instance of ongoing government investigations into a UFO phenomenon that was the subject of multiple official inquiries in the 1950s and 1960s. Funding for the program ended in 2012, according to Warrick. Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the FAA, said in a statement Wednesday to The Washington Post that the air traffic controller was \"unable to verify that any other aircraft was in the area.\" But he alluded to several possibilities. \"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,\" Lunsford said in the statement.

Not long after the pilot reported his observations, the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center alerted an American Airlines flight that was flying over the area en route to San Diego. \"American 1095, uh, let me know if, uh, you see anything pass over you here in the next, uh, 15 miles,\" an air traffic controller said, according to the audio recording, which was obtained by The Post. \"Let you know if anything passes over us?\"\n",

      "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.
